<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">H</span>aving</span> completed our examination of the
simple or elementary bodies, we are now to proceed to those of a
compound nature; but before we enter on this extensive subject, it will
be necessary to make you acquainted with the principal laws by which
chemical combinations are governed.</p>

<p>You recollect, I hope, what we formerly said of the nature of the
attraction of composition, or chemical attraction, or affinity, as it is
also called?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes, I think perfectly; it is the attraction that
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<a name = "page2" id = "page2"> </a>
subsists between bodies of a different nature, which occasions them to
combine and form a compound, when they come in contact, and, according
to Sir H. Davy’s opinion, this effect is produced by the attraction of
the opposite electricities, which prevail in bodies of different
kinds.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well; your definition comprehends the first law of chemical
attraction, which is, that <i>it takes place only between bodies of a
different nature</i>; as, for instance, between an acid and an alkali;
between oxygen and a metal,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That we understand of course; for the attraction between particles of
a similar nature is that of aggregation, or cohesion, which is
independent of any chemical power.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The 2d law of chemical attraction is, that <i>it takes place only
between the most minute particles of bodies</i>; therefore, the more you
divide the particles of the bodies to be combined, the more readily they
act upon each other.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That is again a circumstance which we might
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<a name = "page3" id = "page3"> </a>
have supposed, for the finer the particles of the two substances are,
the more easily and perfectly they will come in contact with each other,
which must greatly facilitate their union. It was for this purpose, you
said, that you used iron filings, in preference to wires or pieces of
iron, for the decomposition of water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It was once supposed that no mechanical power could divide bodies
into particles sufficiently minute for them to act on each other; and
that, in order to produce the extreme division requisite for a chemical
action, one, if not both of the bodies, should be in a fluid state.
There are, however, a&nbsp;few instances in which two solid bodies, very
finely pulverized, exert a chemical action on one another; but such
exceptions to the general rule are very rare indeed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>In all the combinations that we have hitherto seen, one of the
constituents has, I&nbsp;believe, been either liquid or aëriform. In
combustions, for instance, the oxygen is taken from the atmosphere, in
which it existed in the state of gas; and whenever we have seen acids
combine with metals or with alkalies, they were either in a liquid or an
aëriform state.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<a name = "page4" id = "page4"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The 3d law of chemical attraction is, that <i>it can take place
between two, three, four, or even a greater number of bodies</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Oxyds and acids are bodies composed of two constituents; but I
recollect no instance of the combination of a greater number of
principles.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The compound salts, formed by the union of the metals with acids, are
composed of three principles. And there are salts formed by the
combination of the alkalies with the earths which are of a similar
description.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Are they of the same kind as the metallic salts?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; they are very analogous in their nature, although different in
many of their properties.</p>

<p>A methodical nomenclature, similar to that of the acids, has been
adopted for the compound salts. Each individual salt derives its name
from its constituent parts, so that every name implies a knowledge of
the composition of the salt.</p>

<p>The three alkalies, the alkaline earths, and the
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<a name = "page5" id = "page5"> </a>
metals, are called <i>salifiable bases</i> or <i>radicals</i>; and the
acids, <i>salifying principles</i>. The name of each salt is composed
both of that of the acid and the salifiable base; and it terminates in
<i>at</i> or <i>it</i>, according to the degree of the oxygenation of
the acid. Thus, for instance, all those salts which are formed by the
combination of the sulphuric acid with any of the salifiable bases are
called <i>sulphats</i>, and the name of the radical is added for the
specific distinction of the salt; if it be potash, it will compose a
<i>sulphat of potash</i>; if ammonia, <i>sulphat of
ammonia</i>,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The crystals which we obtained from the combination of iron and
sulphuric acid were therefore <i>sulphat of iron</i>?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Precisely; and those which we prepared by dissolving copper in nitric
acid, <i>nitrat of copper</i>, and so on.&mdash;But this is not all; if
the salt be formed by that class of acids which ends in <i>ous</i>,
(which you know indicates a less degree of oxygenation,) the termination
of the name of the salt will be in <i>it</i>, as <i>sulphit of
potash</i>, <i>sulphit of ammonia</i>,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>There must be an immense number of compound
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<a name = "page6" id = "page6"> </a>
salts, since there is so great a variety of salifiable radicals, as well
as of salifying principles.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Their real number cannot be ascertained, since it increases every
day. But we must not proceed further in the investigation of the
compound salts, until we have completed the examination of the nature of
the ingredients of which they are composed.</p>

<p>The 4th law of chemical attraction is, that <i>a&nbsp;change of
temperature always takes place at the moment of combination</i>. This
arises from the extrication of the two electricities in the form of
caloric, which takes place when bodies unite; and also sometimes in part
from a change of capacity of the bodies for heat, which always takes
place when the combination is attended with an increase of density, but
more especially when the compound passes from the liquid to the solid
form. I&nbsp;shall now show you a striking instance of a change of
temperature from chemical union, merely by pouring some nitrous acid on
this small quantity of oil of turpentine&mdash;the oil will instantly
combine with the oxygen of the acid, and produce a considerable change
of temperature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What a blaze! The temperature of the oil and
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<a name = "page7" id = "page7"> </a>
the acid must be greatly raised, indeed, to produce such a violent
combustion.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There is, however, a peculiarity in this combustion, which is, that
the oxygen, instead of being derived from the atmosphere alone, is
principally supplied by the acid itself.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And are not all combustions instances of the change of temperature
produced by the chemical combination of two bodies?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly; when oxygen loses its gaseous form, in order to combine
with a solid body, it becomes condensed, and the caloric evolved
produces the elevation of temperature. The specific gravity of bodies is
at the same time altered by chemical combination; for in consequence of
a change of capacity for heat, a&nbsp;change of density must be
produced.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That was the case with the sulphuric acid and water, which, by being
mixed together, gave out a great deal of heat, and increased in
density.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<a name = "page8" id = "page8"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The 5th law of chemical attraction is, that <i>the properties which
characterise bodies, when separate, are altered or destroyed by their
combination</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Certainly; what, for instance, can be so different from water as the
hydrogen and oxygen gases?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Or what more unlike sulphat of iron than iron or sulphuric acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Every chemical combination is an illustration of this rule. But let
us proceed&mdash;</p>

<p>The 6th law is, that <i>the force of chemical affinity between the
constituents of a body is estimated by that which is required for their
separation</i>. This force is not always proportional to the facility
with which bodies unite; for manganese, for instance, which, you know,
is so much disposed to unite with oxygen that it is never found in a
metallic state, yields it more easily than any other metal.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But, Mrs. B., you speak of estimating the force of attraction between
bodies, by the force required
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<a name = "page9" id = "page9"> </a>
to separate them; how can you measure these forces?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They cannot be precisely measured, but they are comparatively
ascertained by experiment, and can be represented by numbers which
express the relative degrees of attraction.</p>

<p>The 7th law is, that <i>bodies have amongst themselves different
degrees of attraction</i>. Upon this law, (which you may have discovered
yourselves long since,) the whole science of chemistry depends; for it
is by means of the various degrees of affinity which bodies have for
each other, that all the chemical compositions and decompositions are
effected. Every chemical fact or experiment is an instance of the same
kind; and whenever the decomposition of a body is performed by the
addition of any single new substance, it is said to be effected by
<i>simple elective attractions</i>. But it often happens that no simple
substance will decompose a body, and that, in order to effect this, you
must offer to the compound a body which is itself composed of two, or
sometimes three principles, which would not, each separately, perform
the decomposition. In this case there are two new compounds formed in
consequence of a reciprocal decomposition and recomposition. All
instances of this kind are called <i>double elective
attractions</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">10</span>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I confess I do not understand this clearly.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You will easily comprehend it by the assistance of this diagram, in
which the reciprocal forces of attraction are represented by
numbers:</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/diagram.png" width = "376" height = "369"

</p>

<p>We here suppose that we are to decompose sulphat of soda; that is, to
separate the acid from
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<a name = "page11" id = "page11"> </a>
the alkali; if, for this purpose, we add some lime, in order to make it
combine with the acid, we shall fail in our attempt, because the soda
and the sulphuric acid attract each other by a force which is superior,
and (by way of supposition) is represented by the number&nbsp;8; while
the lime tends to unite with this acid by an affinity equal only to the
number&nbsp;6. It is plain, therefore, that the sulphat of soda will not
be decomposed, since a force equal to 8 cannot be overcome by a force
equal only to&nbsp;6.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>So far, this appears very clear.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/diagram1.png" width = "233" height = "263"

</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, we endeavour to decompose this salt by nitric
acid, which tends to combine with soda, we shall be equally
unsuccessful, as nitric acid tends to unite with the alkali by a force
equal only to&nbsp;7.</p>

<p>In neither of these cases of simple elective attraction, therefore,
can we accomplish our purpose. But let us previously combine together
the lime and nitric acid, so as to form a nitrat of lime,
a&nbsp;compound salt, the constituents of which are united by a power
equal to 4. If then we present this compound to the sulphat of soda,
a&nbsp;decomposition will ensue, because the sum of the forces
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<a name = "page12" id = "page12"> </a>
which tend to preserve the two salts in their actual state is not equal
to that of the forces which tend to decompose them, and to form new
combinations. The nitric acid, therefore, will combine with the soda,
and the sulphuric acid with the lime.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I understand you now very well. This double effect takes place
because the numbers 8 and 4, which represent the degrees of attraction
of the constituents of the two original salts, make a sum less than the
numbers 7 and 6, which represent the degrees of attraction of the two
new compounds that will in consequence be formed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Precisely so.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But what is the meaning of <i>quiescent</i> and <i>divellent</i>
forces, which are written in the diagram?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Quiescent forces are those which tend to preserve compounds in a
state of rest, or such as they actually are: divellent forces, those
which tend to destroy that state of combination, and to form new
compounds.</p>

<p>These are the principal circumstances relative to the doctrine of
chemical attractions, which
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<a name = "page13" id = "page13"> </a>
have been laid down as rules by modern chemists; a&nbsp;few others might
be mentioned respecting the same theory, but of less importance, and
such as would take us too far from our plan. I&nbsp;should, however, not
omit to mention that Mr. Berthollet, a&nbsp;celebrated French chemist,
has questioned the uniform operation of elective attraction, and has
advanced the opinion, that, in chemical combinations, the changes which
take place depend not only upon the affinities, but also, in some
degree, on the respective quantities of the substances concerned, on the
heat applied during the process, and some other circumstances.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>In that case, I suppose, there would hardly be two compounds exactly
similar, though composed of the same materials?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it is found that a remarkable uniformity prevails,
as to proportions, between the ingredients of bodies of similar
composition. Thus water, as you may recollect to have seen in a former
conversation, is composed of two volumes of hydrogen gas to one of
oxygen, and this is always found to be precisely the proportion of its
constituents, from whatever source the water be derived. The same
uniformity prevails with regard to the various salts; the acid and
alkali, in
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<a name = "page14" id = "page14"> </a>
each kind of salt, being always found to combine in the same
proportions. Sometimes, it is true, the same acid, and the same alkali,
are capable of making two distinct kinds of salts; but in all these
cases it is found that one of the salts contains just twice, or in some
instances, thrice as much acid, or alkali, as the other.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>If the proportions in which bodies combine are so constant and so
well defined, how can Mr. Berthollet’s remark be reconciled with this
uniform system of combination?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Great as that philosopher’s authority is in chemistry, it is now
generally supposed that his doubts on this subject were in a great
degree groundless, and that the exceptions he has observed in the laws
of definite proportions, have been only apparent, and may be accounted
for consistently with those laws.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Pray, Mrs. B., can you decompose a salt by means of electricity, in
the same way as we decompose water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly; and I am glad this question occurred to you, because it
gives me an opportunity
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<a name = "page15" id = "page15"> </a>
of showing you some very interesting experiments on the subject.</p>

<p>If we dissolve a quantity, however small, of any salt in a glass of
water, and if we plunge into it the extremities of the wires which
proceed from the two ends of the Voltaic battery, the salt will be
gradually decomposed, the acid being attracted by the positive, and the
alkali by the negative wire.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But how can you render that decomposition perceptible<ins class =
"correction" title = "text has .">?&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By placing in contact with the extremities of each wire, in the
solution, pieces of paper stained with certain vegetable colours, which
are altered by the contact of an acid or an alkali. Thus this blue
vegetable preparation called litmus becomes red when touched by an acid;
and the juice of violets becomes green by the contact of an alkali.</p>

<p>But the experiment can be made in a much more distinct manner, by
receiving the extremities of the wires into two different vessels, so
that the alkali shall appear in one vessel and the acid in the
other.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But then the Voltaic circle will not be completed; how can any effect
be produced?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<a name = "page16" id = "page16"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You are right; I ought to have added that the two vessels must be
connected together by some interposed substance capable of conducting
electricity. A&nbsp;piece of moistened cotton-wick answers this purpose
very well. You see that the cotton (<a class = "smallcaps" href =
"#plateXIII">Plate XIII.</a> fig.&nbsp;2.&nbsp;c.) has one end immersed
in one glass and the other end in the other, so as to establish a
communication between any fluids contained in them. We shall now put
into each of the glasses a little glauber salt, or sulphat of soda,
(which consists of an acid and an alkali,) and then we shall fill the
glasses with water, which will dissolve the salt. Let us now connect the
glasses by means of the wires (e,&nbsp;d,) with the two ends of the
battery, thus&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The wires are already giving out small bubbles; is this owing to the
decomposition of the salt?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; these are bubbles produced by the decomposition of the water, as
you saw in a former experiment. In order to render the separation of the
acid from the alkali visible, I&nbsp;pour into the glass&nbsp;(a), which
is connected with the positive wire, a&nbsp;few drops of a solution of
litmus,
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<a name = "page17" id = "page17"> </a>
which the least quantity of acid turns red; and into the other
glass&nbsp;(b), which is connected with the negative wire, I&nbsp;pour a
few drops of the juice of violets&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The blue solution is already turning red all round the wire.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And the violet solution is beginning to turn green. This is indeed
very singular!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You will be still more astonished when we vary the experiment in this
manner:&mdash;These three glasses (fig.&nbsp;3. f, g,&nbsp;h,) are, as
in the former instance, connected together by wetted cotton, but the
middle one alone contains a saline solution, the two others containing
only distilled water, coloured as before by vegetable infusions. Yet, on
making the connection with the battery, the alkali will appear in the
negative glass&nbsp;(h), and the acid in the positive glass&nbsp;(f),
though neither of them contained any saline matter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>So that the acid and alkali must be conveyed right and left from the
central glass, into the
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<a name = "page18" id = "page18"> </a>
other glasses, by means of the connecting moistened cotton?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Exactly so; and you may render the experiment still more striking, by
putting into the central glass (k,&nbsp;fig.&nbsp;3.) an alkaline
solution, the glauber salt being placed into the negative
glass&nbsp;(l), and the positive glass (i) containing only water. The
acid will be attracted by the positive wire&nbsp;(m), and will actually
appear in the vessel&nbsp;(i), after passing through the alkaline
solution&nbsp;(k), without combining with it, although, you know, acids
and alkalies are so much disposed to combine.&mdash;But this
conversation has already much exceeded our usual limits, and we cannot
enlarge more upon this interesting subject at present.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">H</span>aving</span> now given you some idea of the laws
by which chemical attractions are governed, we may proceed to the
examination of bodies which are formed in consequence of these
attractions.</p>

<p>The first class of compounds that present themselves to our notice,
in our gradual ascent to the most complicated combinations, are bodies
composed of only two principles. The sulphurets, phosphurets, carburets,
&amp;c. are of this description; but the most numerous and important of
these compounds are the combinations of oxygen with the various simple
substances with which it has a tendency to unite. Of these you have
already acquired some knowledge, but it will be necessary to enter into
further particulars respecting the nature and properties of those most
deserving our notice. Of this class are the <span class =
"smallroman">ALKALIES</span>
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<a name = "page20" id = "page20"> </a>
and the <span class = "smallroman">EARTHS</span>, which we shall
successively examine.</p>

<p>We shall first take a view of the alkalies, of which there are three,
viz. <span class = "smallroman">POTASH</span>, <span class =
"smallroman">SODA</span>, and <span class = "smallroman">AMMONIA</span>.
The two first are called <i>fixed alkalies</i>, because they exist in a
solid form at the temperature of the atmosphere, and require a great
heat to be volatilised. They consist, as you already know, of metallic
bases combined with oxygen. In potash, the proportions are about
eighty-six parts of potassium to fourteen of oxygen; and in soda,
seventy-seven parts of sodium to twenty-three of oxygen. The third
alkali, ammonia, has been distinguished by the name of <i>volatile
alkali</i>, because its natural form is that of gas. Its composition is
of a more complicated nature, of which we shall speak hereafter.</p>

<p>Some of the earths bear so strong a resemblance in their properties
to the alkalies, that it is difficult to know under which head to place
them. The celebrated French chemist, Fourcroy, has classed two of them
(barytes and strontites) with the alkalies; but as lime and magnesia
have almost an equal title to that rank, I&nbsp;think it better not to
separate them, and therefore have adopted the common method of classing
them with the earths, and of distinguishing them by the name of
<i>alkaline earths</i>.</p>

<p>The general properties of alkalies are, <ins class = "mycorr" title =
"text reads ‘on’">an</ins> acrid
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<a name = "page21" id = "page21"> </a>
burning taste, a&nbsp;pungent smell, and a caustic action on the skin
and flesh.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I wonder they should be caustic, Mrs. B., since they contain so
little oxygen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Whatever substance has an affinity for any one of the constituents of
animal matter, sufficiently powerful to decompose it, is entitled to the
appellation of caustic. The alkalies, in their pure state, have a very
strong attraction for water, for hydrogen, and for carbon, which, you
know, are the constituent principles of oil, and it is chiefly by
absorbing these substances from animal matter that they effect its
decomposition; for, when diluted with a sufficient quantity of water, or
combined with any oily substance, they lose their causticity.</p>

<p>But, to return to the general properties of alkalies&mdash;they
change, as we have already seen, the colour of syrup of violets, and
other blue vegetable infusions, to green; and have, in general,
a&nbsp;very great tendency to unite with acids, although the respective
qualities of these two classes of bodies form a remarkable contrast.</p>

<p>We shall examine the result of the combination of acids and alkalies
more particularly hereafter.
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<a name = "page22" id = "page22"> </a>
It will be sufficient at present to inform you, that whenever acids are
brought in contact with alkalies, or alkaline earths, they unite with a
remarkable eagerness, and form compounds perfectly different from either
of their constituents; these bodies are called <i>neutral</i> or
<i>compound salts</i>.</p>

<p>The dry white powder which you see in this phial is pure caustic
<span class = "smallroman">POTASH</span>; it is very difficult to
preserve it in this state, as it attracts, with extreme avidity, the
moisture from the atmosphere, and if the air were not perfectly
excluded, it would, in a very short time, be actually melted.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It is then, I suppose, always found in a liquid state?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; it exists in nature in a great variety of forms and combinations,
but is never found in its pure separate state; it is combined with
carbonic acid, with which it exists in every part of the vegetable
kingdom, and is most commonly obtained from the ashes of vegetables,
which are the residue that remains after all the other parts have been
volatilised by combustion.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But you once said, that after all the volatile
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<a name = "page23" id = "page23"> </a>
parts of a vegetable were evaporated, the substance that remained was
charcoal?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I am surprised that you should still confound the processes of
volatilisation and combustion. In order to procure charcoal, we
evaporate such parts as can be reduced to vapour by the operation of
heat alone; but when we <i>burn</i> the vegetable, we burn the carbon
also, and convert it into carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That is true; I hope I shall make no more mistakes in my favourite
theory of combustion.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Potash derives its name from the <i>pots</i> in which the vegetables,
from which it was obtained, used formerly to be burnt; the alkali
remained mixed with the ashes at the bottom, and was thence called
potash.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The ashes of a wood-fire, then, are potash, since they are vegetable
ashes?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They always contain more or less potash, but are very far from
consisting of that substance alone, as they are a mixture of various
earths and salts
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<a name = "page24" id = "page24"> </a>
which remain after the combustion of vegetables, and from which it is
not easy to separate the alkali in its pure form. The process by which
potash is obtained, even in the imperfect state in which it is used in
the arts, is much more complicated than simple combustion. It was once
deemed impossible to separate it entirely from all foreign substances,
and it is only in chemical laboratories that it is to be met with in the
state of purity in which you find it in this phial. Wood-ashes are,
however, valuable for the alkali which they contain, and are used for
some purposes without any further preparation. Purified in a certain
degree, they make what is commonly called <i>pearlash</i>, which is of
great efficacy in taking out grease, in washing linen, &amp;c.; for
potash combines readily with oil or fat, with which it forms a compound
well known to you under the name of <i>soap</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Really! Then I should think it would be better to wash all linen with
pearlash than with soap, as, in the latter case, the alkali being
already combined with oil, must be less efficacious in extracting
grease.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Its effect would be too powerful on fine linen, and would injure its
texture; pearlash is therefore only used for that which is of a strong
coarse
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<a name = "page25" id = "page25"> </a>
kind. For the same reason you cannot wash your hands with plain potash;
but, when mixed with oil in the form of soap, it is soft as well as
cleansing, and is therefore much better adapted to the purpose.</p>

<p>Caustic potash, as we already observed, acts on the skin, and animal
fibre, in virtue of its attraction for water and oil, and converts all
animal matter into a kind of saponaceous jelly.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Are vegetables the only source from which potash can be derived?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No: for though far most abundant in vegetables, it is by no means
confined to that class of bodies, being found also on the surface of the
earth, mixed with various minerals, especially with earths and stones,
whence it is supposed to be conveyed into vegetables by the roots of the
plant. It is also met with, though in very small quantities, in some
animal substances. The most common state of potash is that of
<i>carbonat</i>; I&nbsp;suppose you understand what that&nbsp;is?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I believe so; though I do not recollect that you ever mentioned the
word before. If I am not mistaken,
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
<a name = "page26" id = "page26"> </a>
it must be a compound salt, formed by the union of carbonic acid with
potash.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very true; you see how admirably the nomenclature of modern chemistry
is adapted to assist the memory; when you hear the name of a compound,
you necessarily learn what are its constituent parts; and when you are
acquainted with these constituents, you can immediately name the
compound which they form.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Pray, how were bodies arranged and distinguished before this
nomenclature was introduced?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Chemistry was then a much more difficult study; for every substance
had an arbitrary name, which it derived either from the person who
discovered it, as <i>Glauber’s salts</i> for instance; or from some
other circumstance relative to it, though quite unconnected with its
real nature, as potash.</p>

<p>These names have been retained for some of the simple bodies; for as
this class is not numerous, and therefore can easily be remembered, it
has not been thought necessary to change them.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yet I think it would have rendered the new nomenclature more complete
to have methodised
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<a name = "page27" id = "page27"> </a>
the names of the elementary, as well as of the compound bodies, though
it could not have been done in the same manner. But the names of the
simple substances might have indicated their nature, or, at least, some
of their principal properties; and if, like the acids and compound
salts, all the simple bodies had a similar termination, they would have
been immediately known as such. So complete and regular a nomenclature
would, I&nbsp;think, have given a clearer and more comprehensive view of
chemistry than the present, which is a medley of the old and new
terms.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But you are not aware of the difficulty of introducing into science
an entire set of new terms; it obliges all the teachers and professors
to go to school again, and if some of the old names, that are least
exceptionable, were not left as an introduction to the new ones, few
people would have had industry and perseverance enough to submit to the
study of a completely new language; and the inferior classes of artists,
who can only act from habit and routine, would, at least for a time,
have felt material inconvenience from a total change of their habitual
terms. From these considerations, Lavoisier and his colleagues, who
invented the new nomenclature, thought it most prudent to leave a few
links of the old chain, in
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<a name = "page28" id = "page28"> </a>
order to connect it with the new one. Besides, you may easily conceive
the inconvenience which might arise from giving a regular nomenclature
to substances, the simple nature of which is always uncertain; for the
new names might, perhaps, have proved to have been founded in error.
And, indeed, cautious as the inventors of the modern chemical language
have been, it has already been found necessary to modify it in many
respects. In those few cases, however, in which new terms have been
adopted to designate simple bodies, these names have been so contrived
as to indicate one of the chief properties of the body in question; this
is the case with oxygen, which, as I explained to you, signifies
generator of acids; and hydrogen generator of water. If all the
elementary bodies had a similar termination, as you propose, it would be
necessary to change the name of any that might hereafter be found of a
compound nature, which would be very inconvenient in this age of
discovery.</p>

<p>But to return to the alkalies.&mdash;We shall now try to melt some of
this caustic potash in a little water, as a circumstance occurs during
its solution very worthy of observation.&mdash;Do you feel the heat that
is produced?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes, I do; but is not this directly contrary to
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>

our theory of latent heat, according to which <ins class = "correction"

solid, and cold produced when solids are melted?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The latter is really the case in all solutions; and if the solution
of caustic alkalies seems to make an exception to the rule, it does not,
I&nbsp;believe, form any solid objection to the theory. The matter may
be explained thus: When water first comes in contact with the potash, it
produces an effect similar to the slaking of lime, that is, the water is
solidified in combining with the potash, and thus loses its latent heat;
this is the heat that you now feel, and which is, therefore, produced
not by the melting of the solid, but by the solidification of the fluid.
But when there is more water than the potash can absorb and solidify,
the latter then yields to the solvent power of the water; and if we do
not perceive the cold produced by its melting, it is because it is
counterbalanced by the heat previously disengaged.<a class = "tag" name

<p>A very remarkable property of potash is the
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page30" id = "page30"> </a>
formation of glass by its fusion with siliceous earth. You are not yet
acquainted with this last substance, further than its being in the list
of simple bodies. It is sufficient, for the present, that you should
know that sand and flint are chiefly composed of it; alone, it is
infusible, but mixed with potash, it melts when exposed to the heat of a
furnace, combines with the alkali, and runs into glass.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Who would ever have supposed that the same substance which converts
transparent oil into such an opake body as soap, should transform that
opake substance, sand, into transparent glass!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The transparency, or opacity of bodies, does not, I&nbsp;conceive,
depend so much upon their intimate nature, as upon the arrangement of
their particles: we cannot have a more striking instance of this, than
is afforded by the different states of carbon, which, though it commonly
appears in the form of a black opake body, sometimes assumes the most
dazzling transparent form in nature, that of diamond, which, you
recollect, is carbon, and which, in all probability, derives its
beautiful transparency from the peculiar arrangement of its particles
during their crystallisation.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<a name = "page31" id = "page31"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I never should have supposed that the formation of glass was so
simple a process as you describe&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is by no means an easy operation to make perfect glass; for if the
sand, or flint, from which the siliceous earth is obtained, be mixed
with any metallic particles, or other substance, which cannot be
vitrified, the glass will be discoloured, or defaced, by opake
specks.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That, I suppose, is the reason why objects so often appear irregular
and shapeless through a common glass-window.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This species of imperfection proceeds, I believe, from another cause.
It is extremely difficult to prevent the lower part of the vessels, in
which the materials of glass are fused, from containing a more dense
vitreous matter than the upper, on account of the heavier ingredients
falling to the bottom. When this happens, it occasions the appearance of
veins or waves in the glass, from the difference of density in its
several parts, which produces an irregular refraction of the rays of
light that pass through&nbsp;it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<a name = "page32" id = "page32"> </a>
<p>Another species of imperfection sometimes arises from the fusion not
being continued for a length of time sufficient to combine the two
ingredients completely, or from the due proportion of potash and silex
(which are as two to one) not being carefully observed; the glass, in
those cases, will be liable to alteration from the action of the air, of
salts, and especially of acids, which will effect its decomposition by
combining with the potash, and forming compound salts.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What an extremely useful substance potash&nbsp;is!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Besides the great importance of potash in the manufactures of glass
and soap, it is of very considerable utility in many of the other arts,
and in its combinations with several acids, particularly the nitric,
with which it forms saltpetre.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Then saltpetre must be a <i>nitrat of potash</i>? But we are not yet
acquainted with the nitric acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We shall therefore defer entering into the particulars of these
combinations till we come to a general review of the compound salts. In
order
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<a name = "page33" id = "page33"> </a>
to avoid confusion, it will be better at present to confine ourselves to
the alkalies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Cannot you show us the change of colour which you said the alkalies
produced on blue vegetable infusions?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; very easily. I shall dip a piece of white paper into this syrup
of violets, which, you see, is of a deep blue, and dyes the paper of the
same colour.&mdash;As soon as it is dry, we shall dip it into a solution
of potash, which, though itself colourless, will turn the paper
green&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>So it has, indeed! And do the other alkalies produce a similar
effect?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Exactly the same.&mdash;We may now proceed to <span class =
"smallroman">SODA</span>, which, however important, will detain us but a
very short time; as in all its general properties it very strongly
resembles potash; indeed, so great is their similitude, that they have
been long confounded, and they can now scarcely be distinguished, except
by the difference of the salts which they form with acids.</p>

<p>The great source of this alkali is the sea, where,
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
<a name = "page34" id = "page34"> </a>
combined with a peculiar acid, it forms the salt with which the waters
of the ocean are so strongly impregnated.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is not that the common table salt?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The very same; but again we must postpone entering into the
particulars of this interesting combination, till we treat of the
neutral salts. Soda may be obtained from common salt; but the easiest
and most usual method of procuring it is by the combustion of marine
plants, an operation perfectly analogous to that by which potash is
obtained from vegetables.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>From what does soda derive its name?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>From a plant called by us <i>soda</i>, and by the Arabs <i>kali</i>,
which affords it in great abundance. Kali has, indeed, given its name to
the alkalies in general.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Does soda form glass and soap in the same manner as potash?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, it does; it is of equal importance in the
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<a name = "page35" id = "page35"> </a>
arts, and is even preferred to potash for some purposes; but you will
not be able to distinguish their properties till we examine the compound
salts which they form with acids; we must therefore leave soda for the
present, and proceed to <span class = "smallroman">AMMONIA</span>, or
the <span class = "smallroman">VOLATILE ALKALI</span>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I long to hear something of this alkali; is it not of the same nature
as hartshorn?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, it is, as you will see by-and-bye. This alkali is seldom found
in nature in its pure state; it is most commonly extracted from a
compound salt, called <i>sal ammoniac</i>, which was formerly imported
from <i>Ammonia</i>, a&nbsp;region of Libya, from which both these salts
and the alkali derive their names. The crystals contained in this bottle
are specimens of this salt, which consists of a combination of ammonia
and muriatic acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Then it should be called <i>muriat of ammonia</i>; for though I am
ignorant what muriatic acid is, yet I know that its combination with
ammonia cannot but be so called; and I am surprised to see sal ammoniac
inscribed on the label.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<a name = "page36" id = "page36"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is the name by which it has been so long known, that the modern
chemists have not yet succeeded in banishing it altogether; and it is
still sold under that name by druggists, though by scientific chemists
it is more properly called muriat of ammonia.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Both the popular and the common name should be inscribed on
labels&mdash;this would soon introduce the new nomenclature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>By what means can the ammonia be separated from the muriatic
acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By chemical attractions; but this operation is too complicated for
you to understand, till you are better acquainted with the agency of
affinities.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And when extracted from the salt, what kind of substance is
ammonia?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Its natural form, at the temperature of the atmosphere, when free
from combination, is that of gas; and in this state it is called
<i>ammoniacal gas</i>.
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<a name = "page37" id = "page37"> </a>
But it mixes very readily with water, and can be thus obtained in a
liquid form.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>You said that ammonia was more complicated in its composition than
the other alkalies; pray of what principles does it consist?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It was discovered a few years since, by Berthollet, a&nbsp;celebrated
French chemist, that it consisted of about one part of hydrogen to four
parts of nitrogen. Having heated ammoniacal gas under a receiver, by
causing the electrical spark to pass repeatedly through it, he found
that it increased considerably in bulk, lost all its alkaline
properties, and was actually converted into hydrogen and nitrogen gases;
and from the latest and most accurate experiments, the proportions
appear to be, one volume of nitrogen gas to three of <ins class =
"mycorr" title = "text reads ‘oxygen’">hydrogen</ins> gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Ammonia, therefore, has not, like the two other alkalies,
a&nbsp;metallic basis?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is believed it has, though it is extremely difficult to reconcile
that idea with what I have just stated of its chemical nature. But the
fact is, that
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
<a name = "page38" id = "page38"> </a>
although this supposed metallic basis of ammonia has never been obtained
distinct and separate, yet both Professor Berzelius, of Stockholm, and
Sir H. Davy, have succeeded in forming a combination of mercury with the
basis of ammonia, which has so much the appearance of an amalgam, that
it strongly corroborates the idea of ammonia having a metallic basis.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag22" id = "tag22" href = "#note22">*</a> But
these theoretical points are full of difficulties and doubts, and it
would be useless to dwell any longer upon them.</p>

<p>Let us therefore return to the properties of volatile alkali.
Ammoniacal gas is considerably lighter than oxygen gas, and only about
half the weight of atmospherical air. It possesses most of the
properties of the fixed alkalies; but cannot be of so much use in the
arts on account of its volatile nature. It is, therefore, never employed
in the manufacture of glass, but it forms soap with oils equally as well
as potash and soda; it resembles them likewise in its strong attraction
for water; for which reason it can be collected in a receiver over
mercury only.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<a name = "page39" id = "page39"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I do not understand this?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Do you recollect the method which we used to collect gases in a
glass-receiver over water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Perfectly.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Ammoniacal gas has so strong a tendency to unite with water, that,
instead of passing through that fluid, it would be instantaneously
absorbed by it. We can therefore neither use water for that purpose, nor
any other liquid of which water is a component part; so that, in order
to collect this gas, we are obliged to have recourse to mercury,
(a&nbsp;liquid which has no action upon it,) and a mercurial bath is
used instead of a water bath, such as we employed on former occasions.
Water impregnated with this gas is nothing more than the fluid which you
mentioned at the beginning of the conversation&mdash;hartshorn; it is
the ammoniacal gas escaping from the water which gives it so powerful a
smell.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But there is no appearance of effervescence in hartshorn.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
<a name = "page40" id = "page40"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because the particles of gas that rise from the water are too subtle
and minute for their effect to be visible.</p>

<p>Water diminishes in density, by being impregnated with ammoniacal
gas; and this augmentation of bulk increases its capacity for
caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>In making hartshorn, then, or impregnating water with ammonia, heat
must be absorbed, and cold produced?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That effect would take place if it was not counteracted by another
circumstance; the gas is liquefied by incorporating with the water, and
gives out its latent heat. The condensation of the gas more than
counterbalances the expansion of the water; therefore, upon the whole,
heat is produced.&mdash;But if you dissolve ammoniacal gas with ice or
snow, cold is produced.&mdash;Can you account for that?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The gas, in being condensed into a liquid, must give out heat; and,
on the other hand, the snow or ice, in being rarefied into a liquid,
must absorb heat; so that, between the opposite effects, I&nbsp;should
have supposed the original temperature would have been preserved.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<a name = "page41" id = "page41"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But you have forgotten to take into the account the rarefaction of
the water (or melted ice) by the impregnation of the gas; and this is
the cause of the cold which is ultimately produced.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is the <i>sal volatile</i> (the smell of which so strongly resembles
hartshorn) likewise a preparation of ammonia?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is carbonat of ammonia dissolved in water; and which, in its
concrete state, is commonly called salts of hartshorn. Ammonia is
caustic, like the fixed alkalies, as you may judge by the pungent
effects of hartshorn, which cannot be taken internally, nor applied to
delicate external parts, without being plentifully diluted with
water.&mdash;Oil and acids are very excellent antidotes for alkaline
poisons; can you guess why?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Perhaps, because the oil combines with the alkali, and forms soap,
and thus destroys its caustic properties; and the acid converts it into
a compound salt, which, I&nbsp;suppose, is not so pernicious as caustic
alkali.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Precisely so.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
<a name = "page42" id = "page42"> </a>
<p>Ammoniacal gas, if it be mixed with atmospherical air, and a burning
taper repeatedly plunged into it, will burn with a large flame of a
peculiar yellow colour.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But pray tell me, can ammonia be procured from this Lybian salt
only?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>So far from it, that it is contained in, and may be extracted from,
all animal substances whatever. Hydrogen and nitrogen are two of the
chief constituents of animal matter; it is therefore not surprising that
they should occasionally meet and combine in those proportions that
compose ammonia. But this alkali is more frequently generated by the
spontaneous decomposition of animal substances; the hydrogen and
nitrogen gases that arise from putrefied bodies combine, and form the
volatile alkali.</p>

<p>Muriat of ammonia, instead of being exclusively brought from Lybia,
as it originally was, is now chiefly prepared in Europe, by chemical
processes. Ammonia, although principally extracted from this salt, can
also be produced by a great variety of other substances. The horns of
cattle, especially those of deer, yield it in abundance, and it is from
this circumstance that a solution of ammonia in water has been called
hartshorn. It may likewise
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
<a name = "page43" id = "page43"> </a>
be procured from wool, flesh, and bones; in a word, any animal substance
whatever yields it by decomposition.</p>

<p>We shall now lay aside the alkalies, however important the subject
may be, till we treat of their combination with acids. The next time we
meet we shall examine the earths.</p>

<div class = "footnote">

<p><a name = "note21" id = "note21" href = "#tag21">*</a>
This defence of the general theory, however plausible, is liable to some
obvious objections. The phenomenon might perhaps be better accounted for
by supposing that a solution of alkali in water has less capacity for
heat than either water or alkali in their separate state.</p>

<p><a name = "note22" id = "note22" href = "#tag22">*</a>
This amalgam is easily obtained, by placing a globule of mercury upon a
piece of muriat, or carbonat of ammonia, and electrifying this globule
by the Voltaic battery. The globule instantly begins to expand to three
or four times its former size, and becomes much less fluid, though
without losing its metallic lustre, a&nbsp;change which is ascribed to
the metallic basis of ammonia uniting with the mercury. This is an
extremely curious experiment.</p>

will be unnecessary to enter into any particulars respecting them; we
shall confine our remarks, therefore, to the first five. They are
composed, as you have already learnt, of a metallic basis combined with
oxygen; and, from this circumstance, are incombustible.</p>

<p>Yet I have seen turf burnt in the country, and it makes an excellent
fire; the earth becomes red hot, and produces a very great quantity of
heat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is not the earth that burns, my dear, but the roots, grass, and
other remnants of vegetables that are intermixed with it. The caloric,
which is produced by the combustion of these substances, makes the earth
red hot, and this being a bad conductor of heat, retains its caloric a
long time; but were you to examine it when cooled, you would find that
it had not absorbed one particle of oxygen, nor suffered any alteration
from the fire. Earth is, however, from the circumstance just mentioned,
an excellent radiator of heat, and owes its utility, when mixed with
fuel, solely to that property. It is in this point of view that Count
Rumford has recommended balls of incombustible substances to be arranged
in fire-places, and mixed with the coals, by which means the caloric
disengaged by the combustion of the latter is more perfectly reflected
into the room, and an expense of fuel is saved.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I expected that the list of earths would be much more considerable.
When I think of the great
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>

variety of soils, I&nbsp;am astonished that there is not a greater
number of earths to form them.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You might, indeed, almost confine that number to four; for barytes,
strontites, and the others of late discovery, act but so small a part in
this great theatre, that they cannot be reckoned as essential to the
general formation of the globe. And you must not confine your idea of
earths to the formation of soil; for rock, marble, chalk, slate, sand,
flint, and all kinds of stones, from the precious jewels to the
commonest pebbles; in a word, all the immense variety of mineral
products, may be referred to some of these earths, either in a simple
state, or combined the one with the other, or blended with other
ingredients.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Precious stones composed of earth! That seems very difficult to
conceive.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is it more extraordinary than that the most precious of all jewels,

<span class = "pagenum">47</span>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I did not specify the exception, as I knew you were so well
acquainted with it. Besides, I&nbsp;would call a diamond a mineral
rather than a stone, as the latter term always implies the presence of
some earth.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I cannot conceive how such coarse materials can be converted into
such beautiful productions.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We are very far from understanding all the secret resources of
nature; but I do not think the spontaneous formation of the crystals,
which we call precious stones, one of the most difficult phenomena to
comprehend.</p>

<p>By the slow and regular work of ages, perhaps of hundreds of ages,
these earths may be gradually dissolved by water, and as gradually
deposited by their solvent in the undisturbed process of
crystallisation. The regular arrangement of their particles, during
their reunion in a solid mass, gives them that brilliancy, transparency,
and beauty, for which they are so much admired; and renders them in
appearance so totally different from their rude and primitive
ingredients.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<a name = "page48" id = "page48"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But how does it happen that they are spontaneously dissolved, and
afterwards crystallised?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The scarcity of many kinds of crystals, as rubies, emeralds, topazes,
&amp;c. shows that their formation is not an operation very easily
carried on in nature. But cannot you imagine that when water, holding in
solution some particles of earth, filters through the crevices of hills
or mountains, and at length dribbles into some cavern, each successive
drop may be slowly evaporated, leaving behind it the particle of earth
which it held in solution? You know that crystallisation is more regular
and perfect, in proportion as the evaporation of the solvent is slow and
uniform; nature, therefore, who knows no limit of time, has, in all
works of this kind, an infinite advantage over any artist who attempts
to imitate such productions.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I can now conceive that the arrangement of the particles of earth,
during crystallisation, may be such as to occasion transparency, by
admitting a free passage to the rays of light; but I cannot understand
why crystallised earths should assume such beautiful colours as most of
them do. Sapphire,
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<a name = "page49" id = "page49"> </a>
for instance, is of a celestial blue; ruby, a&nbsp;deep red; topaz,
a&nbsp;brilliant yellow?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Nothing is more simple than to suppose that the arrangement of their
particles is such, as to transmit some of the coloured rays of light,
and to reflect others, in which case the stone must appear of the colour
of the rays which it reflects. But besides, it frequently happens that
the colour of a stone is owing to a mixture of some metallic matter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Pray, are the different kinds of precious stones each composed of one
individual earth, or are they formed of a combination of several
earths?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>A great variety of materials enters into the composition of most of
them; not only several earths, but sometimes salts and metals. The
earths, however, in their simple state, frequently form very beautiful
crystals; and, indeed, it is in that state only that they can be
obtained perfectly pure.</p>

it is found, which are similar to those you have described.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but this spar is a very imperfect specimen of crystallisation;
it consists of a variety of ingredients confusedly blended together, as
you may judge by its opacity, and by the various colours and appearances
which it exhibits.</p>

<p>But, in examining the earths in their most perfect and agreeable
form, we must not lose sight of that state in which they are commonly
found, and which, if less pleasing to the eye, is far more interesting
by its utility.</p>

<p>All the earths are more or less endowed with alkaline properties; but
there are four, barytes, magnesia, lime, and strontites, which are
called <i>alkaline earths</i>, because they possess those qualities in
so great a degree, as to entitle them, in most respects, to the rank of
alkalies. They combine and form compound salts with acids, in the same
way as alkalies; they are, like them, susceptible of a considerable
degree of causticity, and are acted upon in a similar manner by chemical
tests.&mdash;The remaining earths, silex and alumine, with one or two
others of late discovery, are in some degree more earthy, that is to
say, they possess more completely the properties common to all the
earths, which
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<a name = "page51" id = "page51"> </a>
are, insipidity, dryness, unalterableness in the fire,
infusibility,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yet, did you not tell us that silex, or siliceous earth, when mixed
with an alkali, was fusible, and run into glass?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, my dear; but the characteristic properties of earths, which I
have mentioned, are to be considered as belonging to them in a state of
purity only; a&nbsp;state in which they are very seldom to be met with
in nature.&mdash;Besides these general properties, each earth has its
own specific characters, by which it is distinguished from any other
substance.&mdash;Let us therefore review them separately.</p>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">Silex</span>, or <span class =
"smallroman">SILICA</span>, abounds in flint, sand, sandstone, agate,
jasper, &amp;c.; it forms the basis of many precious stones, and
particularly of those which strike fire with steel. It is rough to the
touch, scratches and wears away metals; it is acted upon by no acid but
the fluoric, and is not soluble in water by any known process; but
nature certainly dissolves it by means with which we are unacquainted,
and thus produces a variety of siliceous crystals, and amongst these
<i>rock crystal</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
<a name = "page52" id = "page52"> </a>
which is the purest specimen of this earth. Silex appears to have been
intended by Providence to form the solid basis of the globe, to serve as
a foundation for the original mountains, and give them that hardness and
durability which has enabled them to resist the various revolutions
which the surface of the earth has successively undergone. From these
mountains siliceous rocks have, during the course of ages, been
gradually detached by torrents of water, and brought down in fragments;
these, in the violence and rapidity of their descent, are sometimes
crumbled to sand, and in this state form the beds of rivers and of the
sea, chiefly composed of siliceous materials. Sometimes the fragments
are broken without being pulverised by their fall, and assume the form
of pebbles, which gradually become rounded and polished.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray what is the true colour of silex, which forms such a variety of
different coloured substances? Sand is brown, flint is nearly black, and
precious stones are of all colours.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Pure silex, such as is found only in the chemist’s laboratory, is
perfectly white, and the various colours which it assumes, in the
different substances
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<a name = "page53" id = "page53"> </a>
you have just mentioned, proceed from the different ingredients with
which it is mixed in them.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I wonder that silex is not more valuable, since it forms the basis of
so many precious stones.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You must not forget that the value we set upon precious stones
depends in a great measure upon the scarcity with which nature affords
them; for, were those productions either common or perfectly imitable by
art, they would no longer, notwithstanding their beauty, be so highly
esteemed. But the real value of siliceous earth, in many of the most
useful arts, is very extensive. Mixed with clay, it forms the basis of
all the various kinds of earthen ware, from the most common utensils to
the most refined ornaments.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And we must recollect its importance in the formation of glass with
potash.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Nor should we omit to mention, likewise, many other important uses of
silex, such as being the chief ingredient of some of the most durable
cements, of mortar,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
<a name = "page54" id = "page54"> </a>
<p>I said before, that siliceous earth combined with no acid but the
fluoric; it is for this reason that glass is liable to be attacked by
that acid only, which, from its strong affinity for silex, forces that
substance from its combination with the potash, and thus destroys the
glass.</p>

<p>We will now hasten to proceed to the other earths, for I am rather
apprehensive of your growing weary of this part of our subject.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The history of the earths is not quite so entertaining as that of the
simple substances.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Perhaps not; but it is absolutely indispensable that you should know
something of them; for they form the basis of so many <ins class =
"mycorr" title = "text reads ‘interesing’">interesting</ins> and
important compounds, that their total omission would throw great
obscurity on our general outline of chemical science. We shall, however,
review them in as cursory a manner as the subject can admit&nbsp;of.</p>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">Alumine</span> derives its name from a
compound salt called <i>alum</i>, of which it forms the basis.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But it ought to be just the contrary, Mrs.&nbsp;B.;
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<a name = "page55" id = "page55"> </a>
the simple body should give, instead of taking, its name from the
compound.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is true; but as the compound salt was known long before its
basis was discovered, it was very natural that when the earth was at
length separated from the acid, it should derive its name from the
compound from which it was obtained. However, to remove your scruples,
we will call the salt according to the new nomenclature, <i>sulphat of
alumine</i>. From this combination, alumine may be obtained in its pure
state; it is then soft to the touch, makes a paste with water, and
hardens in the fire. In nature, it is found chiefly in clay, which
contains a considerable proportion of this earth; it is very abundant in
fuller’s earth, slate, and a variety of other mineral productions. There
is indeed scarcely any mineral substance more useful to mankind than
alumine. In the state of clay, it forms large strata of the earth, gives
consistency to the soil of valleys, and of all low and damp spots, such
as swamps and marshes. The beds of lakes, ponds, and springs, are almost
entirely of clay; instead of allowing of the filtration of water, as
sand does, it forms an impenetrable bottom, and by this means water is
accumulated in the caverns of the earth, producing
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
<a name = "page56" id = "page56"> </a>
those reservoirs whence springs issue, and spout out at the surface.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I always thought that these subterraneous reservoirs of water were
bedded by some hard stone, or rock, which the water could not
penetrate.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is not the case; for in the course of time water would
penetrate, or wear away silex, or any other kind of stone, while it is
effectually stopped by clay, or alumine.</p>

<p>The solid compact soils, such as are fit for corn, owe their
consistence in a great measure to alumine; this earth is therefore used
to improve sandy or chalky soils, which do not retain a sufficient
quantity of water for the purpose of vegetation.</p>

<p>Alumine is the most essential ingredient in all potteries. It enters
into the composition of brick, as well as that of the finest porcelain;
the addition of silex and water hardens it, renders it susceptible of a
degree of vitrification, and makes it perfectly fit for its various
purposes.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I can scarcely conceive that brick and china should be made of the
same materials.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<a name = "page57" id = "page57"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Brick consists almost entirely of baked clay; but a certain
proportion of silex is essential to the formation of earthen or stone
ware. In common potteries sand is used for that purpose; a&nbsp;more
pure silex is, I&nbsp;believe, necessary for the composition of
porcelain, as well as a finer kind of clay; and these materials are, no
doubt, more carefully prepared, and curiously wrought, in the one case
than in the other. Porcelain owes its beautiful semitransparency to a
commencement of vitrification.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But the commonest earthen-ware, though not transparent, is covered
with a kind of glazing.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That precaution is equally necessary for use as for beauty, as the
ware would be liable to be spoiled and corroded by a variety of
substances, if not covered with a coating of this kind. In porcelain it
consists of enamel, which is a fine white opake glass, formed of
metallic oxyds, sand, salts, and such other materials as are susceptible
of vitrification. The glazing of common earthen-ware is made chiefly of
oxyd of lead, or sometimes merely of salt, which, when thinly spread
over earthen vessels, will, at a certain heat, run into opake glass.</p>

<p class = "speaker"><ins class = "mycorr" title = "speaker name missing: supplied from other editions">CAROLINE.</ins></p>

<p>And of what nature are the colours which are used for painting
porcelain<ins class = "mycorr" title = "text has .">?&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They are all composed of metallic oxyds, so that these colours,
instead of receiving injury from the application of fire, are
strengthened and developed by its action, which causes them to undergo
different degrees of oxydation.</p>

<p>Alumine and silex are not only often combined by art, but they have
in nature a very strong tendency to unite, and are found combined, in
different proportions, in various gems and other minerals. Indeed, many
of the precious stones, such as ruby, oriental sapphire, amethyst,
&amp;c. consist chiefly of alumine.</p>


<p class = "space">
We may now proceed to the alkaline earths, I&nbsp;shall say but a few
words on <span class = "smallroman">BARYTES</span>, as it is hardly ever
used, except in chemical laboratories. It is remarkable for its great
weight, and its strong alkaline properties, such as destroying animal
substances, turning green some blue vegetable colours, and showing a
powerful attraction for acids; this last property it possesses to such a
degree, particularly with regard to the sulphuric acid, that it will
always detect its presence in any substance or combination whatever, by
immediately uniting with it, and forming a sulphat of barytes. This
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<a name = "page59" id = "page59"> </a>
renders it a very valuable chemical test. It is found pretty abundantly
in nature in the state of carbonat, from which the pure earth can be
easily separated.</p>


<p class = "space">
The next earth we have to consider is <span class =
"smallroman">LIME</span>. This is a substance of too great and general
importance to be passed over so slightly as the last.</p>

<p>Lime is strongly alkaline. In nature it is not met with in its simple
state, as its affinity for water and carbonic acid is so great, that it
is always found combined with these substances, with which it forms the
common lime-stone; but it is separated in the kiln from these
ingredients, which are volatilised whenever a sufficient degree of heat
is applied.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pure lime, then, is nothing but lime-stone, which has been deprived,
in the kiln, of its water and carbonic acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Precisely: in this state it is called <i>quick-lime</i>, and it is so
caustic, that it is capable of decomposing the dead bodies of animals
very rapidly, without their undergoing the process of
putrefaction.&mdash;I&nbsp;have here some quick lime, which is kept
carefully corked up in a bottle to prevent the access
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<a name = "page60" id = "page60"> </a>
of air; for were it at all exposed to the atmosphere, it would absorb
both moisture and carbonic acid gas from it, and be soon slaked. Here is
also some lime-stone&mdash;we shall pour a little water on each, and
observe the effects that result from&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How the quick-lime hisses! It is become excessively hot!&mdash;It
swells, and now it bursts and crumbles to powder, while the water
appears to produce no kind of alteration on the lime-stone.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because the lime-stone is already saturated with water, whilst the
quick-lime, which has been deprived of it in the kiln, combines with it
with very great avidity, and produces this prodigious disengagement of
heat, the cause of which I formerly explained to you; do you
recollect&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes; you said that the heat did not proceed from the lime, but from
the water which was <i>solidified</i>, and thus parted with its heat of
liquidity.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well. If we continue to add successive quantities of water to
the lime after being slaked
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<a name = "page61" id = "page61"> </a>
and crumbled as you see, it will then gradually be diffused in the
water, till it will at length be dissolved in it, and entirely
disappear; but for this purpose it requires no less than 700 times its
weight of water. This solution is called <i>lime-water</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How very small, then, is the proportion of lime dissolved!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Barytes is still of more difficult solution; it dissolves only in 900
times its weight of water: but it is much more soluble in the state of
crystals. The liquid contained in this bottle is lime-water; it is often
used as a medicine, chiefly, I&nbsp;believe, for the purpose of
combining with, and neutralising, the superabundant acid which it meets
with in the stomach.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I am surprised that it is so perfectly clear; it does not at all
partake of the whiteness of the lime.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Have you forgotten that, in solutions, the solid body is so minutely
subdivided by the fluid as to become invisible, and therefore will not
in the least degree impair the transparency of the solvent?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
<a name = "page62" id = "page62"> </a>
<p>I said that the attraction of lime for carbonic acid was so strong,
that it would absorb it from the atmosphere. We may see this effect by
exposing a glass of lime-water to the air; the lime will then separate
from the water, combine with the carbonic acid, and re-appear on the
surface in the form of a white film, which is carbonat of lime, commonly
called <i>chalk</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Chalk is, then, a&nbsp;compound salt! I never should have supposed
that those immense beds of chalk, that we see in many parts of the
country, were a salt.&mdash;Now, the white film begins to appear on the
surface of the water; but it is far from resembling hard solid
chalk.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is owing to its state of extreme division; in a little time it
will collect into a more compact mass, and subside at the bottom of the
glass.</p>

<p>If you breathe into lime-water, the carbonic acid, which is mixed
with the air that you expire, will produce the same effect. It is an
experiment very easily made;&mdash;I&nbsp;shall pour some lime-water
into this glass tube, and, by breathing repeatedly into it, you will
soon perceive a precipitation of chalk&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<a name = "page63" id = "page63"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I see already a small white cloud formed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is composed of minute particles of chalk; at present it floats in
the water, but it will soon subside.</p>

<p>Carbonat of lime, or chalk, you see, is insoluble in water, since the
lime which was dissolved re-appears when converted into chalk; but you
must take notice of a very singular circumstance, which is, that chalk
is soluble in water impregnated with carbonic acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is very curious, indeed, that carbonic acid gas should render lime
soluble in one instance, and insoluble in the other!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I have here a bottle of Seltzer water, which, you know, is strongly
impregnated with carbonic acid:&mdash;let us pour a little of it into a
glass of lime-water. You see that it immediately forms a precipitation
of carbonat of lime?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes, a white cloud appears.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
<a name = "page64" id = "page64"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I shall now pour an additional quantity of the Seltzer water into the
lime-water&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>How singular! The cloud is re-dissolved, and the liquid is again
transparent.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>All the mystery depends upon this circumstance, that carbonat of lime
is soluble in carbonic acid, whilst it is insoluble in water; the first
quantity of carbonic acid, therefore, which I introduce into the
lime-water, was employed in forming the carbonat of lime, which remained
visible, until an additional quantity of carbonic acid dissolved it.
Thus, you see, when the lime and carbonic acid are in proper proportions
to form chalk, the white cloud appears, but when the acid predominates,
the chalk is no sooner formed than it is dissolved.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That is now the case; but let us try whether a further addition of
lime-water will again precipitate the chalk.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It does, indeed! The cloud re-appears, because,
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<a name = "page65" id = "page65"> </a>
I&nbsp;suppose, there is now no more of the carbonic acid than is
necessary to form chalk; and, in order to dissolve the chalk,
a&nbsp;superabundance of acid is required.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We have, I think, carried this experiment far enough; every
repetition would but exhibit the same appearances.</p>

<p>Lime combines with most of the acids, to which the carbonic (as being
the weakest) readily yields it; but these combinations we shall have an
opportunity of noticing more particularly hereafter. It unites with
phosphorus, and with sulphur, in their simple state; in short, of all
the earths, lime is that which nature employs most frequently, and most
abundantly, in its innumerable combinations. It is the basis of all
calcareous earths and stones; we find it likewise in the animal and the
vegetable creations.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And in the arts is not lime of very great utility?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Scarcely any substance more so; you know that it is a most essential
requisite in building, as it constitutes the basis of all cements, such
as mortar, stucco, plaister,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
<a name = "page66" id = "page66"> </a>
<p>Lime is also of infinite importance in agriculture; it lightens and
warms soils that are too cold, and compact, in consequence of too great
a proportion of clay.&mdash;But it would be endless to enumerate the
various purposes for which it is employed; and you know enough of it to
form some idea of its importance; we shall, therefore, now proceed to
the third alkaline earth, <span class =
"smallroman">MAGNESIA</span>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I am already pretty well acquainted with that earth; it is a
medicine.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is in the state of carbonat that magnesia is usually employed
medicinally; it then differs but little in appearance from its simple
form, which is that of a very fine light white powder. It dissolves in
2000 times its weight of water, but forms with acids extremely soluble
salts. It has not so great an attraction for acids as lime, and
consequently yields them to the latter. It is found in a great variety
of mineral combinations, such as slate, mica, amianthus, and more
particularly in a certain lime stone, which has lately been discovered
by Mr. Tennant to contain it in very great quantities. It does not
attract and solidify water, like lime: but when mixed with water and
exposed to the atmosphere, it slowly absorbs
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<a name = "page67" id = "page67"> </a>
carbonic acid from the latter, and thus loses its causticity. Its chief
use in medicine is, like that of lime, derived from its readiness to
combine with, and neutralise, the acid which it meets with in the
stomach.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yet, you said that it was taken in the state of carbonat, in which
case it has already combined with an acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but the carbonic is the last of all the acids in the order of
affinities; it will therefore yield the magnesia to any of the others.
It is, however, frequently taken in its caustic state as a remedy for
flatulence. Combined with sulphuric acid, magnesia forms another and
more powerful medicine, commonly called <i>Epsom salt</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And properly, <i>sulphat of magnesia</i>, I&nbsp;suppose? Pray why
was it ever called Epsom salt?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because there is a spring in the neighbourhood of Epsom which
contains this salt in great abundance.</p>

<p>The last alkaline earth which we have to mention is <span class =

Dr. Hope a few years ago. It so strongly resembles barytes in its
properties, and is so sparingly found in nature, and of so little use in
the arts, that it will not be necessary to enter into any particulars
respecting it. One of the remarkable characteristic properties of
strontites is, that its salts, when dissolved in spirit of wine, tinge
the flame of a deep red, or blood colour.</p>

metallic oxyds, you have already acquired some general notions. This
subject, though highly interesting in its details, is not of sufficient
importance to our concise view of chemistry, to be particularly treated
of; but it is absolutely necessary that you should be better acquainted
with the acids, and likewise with their combinations with the alkalies,
which form the triple compounds called <span class =
"smallroman">NEUTRAL SALTS</span>.</p>

<p>The class of acids is characterised by very distinct properties. They
all change blue vegetable infusions to a red colour: they are all more
or less sour to the taste; and have a general tendency to combine with
the earths, alkalies, and metallic oxyds.</p>

<p>You have, I&nbsp;believe, a clear idea of the nomenclature by which
the base (or radical) of the acid, and the various degrees of
acidification, are expressed?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes, I think so; the acid is distinguished by the
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
<a name = "page70" id = "page70"> </a>
name of its base, and its degree of oxydation, that is, the quantity of
oxygen it contains, by the termination of that name in <i>ous</i> or
<i>ic</i>; thus sulphure<i>ous</i> acid is that formed by the smallest
proportion of oxygen combined with sulphur; sulphur<i>ic</i> acid that
which results from the combination of sulphur with the greatest quantity
of oxygen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>A still greater latitude may, in many cases, be allowed to the
proportions of oxygen than can be combined with <ins class = "mycorr"
title = "text reads ‘acidificiable’">acidifiable</ins> radicals; for
several of these radicals are susceptible of uniting with a quantity of
oxygen so small as to be insufficient to give them the properties of
acids; in these cases, therefore, they are converted into oxyds. Such is
sulphur, which by exposure to the atmosphere with a degree of heat
inadequate to produce inflammation, absorbs a small proportion of
oxygen, which colours it red or brown. This, therefore, is the first
degree of oxygenation of sulphur; the 2d converts it into
sulphur<i>ous</i> acid; the 3d into the sulphur<i>ic</i> acid; and
4thly, if it was found capable of combining with a still larger
proportion of oxygen, it would then be termed <i>super-oxygenated
sulphuric acid</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Are these various degrees of oxygenation common to all the acids?</p>

<a name = "page71" id = "page71"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; they vary much in this respect: some are susceptible of only one
degree of oxygenation; others, of two, or three; there are but very few
that will admit of more.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The modern nomenclature must be of immense advantage in pointing out
so easily the nature of the acids, and their various degrees of
oxygenation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Till lately many of the acids had not been decomposed; but analogy
afforded so strong a proof of their compound nature, that I never could
reconcile myself to classing them with the simple bodies, though this
division has been adopted by several chemical writers. At present there
are only the muriatic and the fluoric acids, which have not had their
bases distinctly separated.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>We have heard of a great variety of acids; pray how many are there in
all?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I believe there are reckoned at present thirty-four, and their number
is constantly increasing, as the science improves; but the most
important,
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
<a name = "page72" id = "page72"> </a>
and those to which we shall almost entirely confine our attention, are
but few. I&nbsp;shall, however, give you a general view of the whole;
and then we shall more particularly examine those that are the most
essential.</p>

<p>This class of bodies was formerly divided into mineral, vegetable,
and animal acids, according to the substances from which they were
commonly obtained.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That, I should think, must have been an excellent arrangement; why
was it altered?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because in many cases it produced confusion. In which class, for
instance, would you place carbonic acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Now I see the difficulty. I should be at a loss where to place it, as
you have told us that it exists in the animal, vegetable, and mineral
kingdoms.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>There would be the same objection with respect to phosphoric acid,
which, though obtained chiefly from bones, can also, you said, be found
in small quantities in stones, and likewise in some plants.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You see, therefore, the propriety of changing
<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
<a name = "page73" id = "page73"> </a>
this mode of classification. These objections do not exist in the
present nomenclature; for the composition and nature of each individual
acid is in some degree pointed out, instead of the class of bodies from
which it is extracted; and, with regard to the more general division of
acids, they are classed under these three heads:</p>

<p>First, Acids of known or supposed simple bases, which are formed by
the union of these bases with oxygen. They are the following:</p>

<p>This class comprehends the most anciently known and most important
acids. The sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic were formerly, and are still
frequently, called <i>mineral acids</i>.</p>

<p>2dly, Acids that have double or binary radicals, and which
consequently consist of triple combinations. These are the vegetable
acids, whose common radical is a compound of hydrogen and carbon.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">74</span>

<p>But if the basis of all the vegetable acids be the same, it should
form but one acid; it may indeed combine with different proportions of
oxygen, but the nature of the acid must be the same.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The only difference that exists in the basis of vegetable acids, is
the various proportions of hydrogen and carbon from which they are
severally composed. But this is enough to produce a number of acids
apparently very dissimilar. That they do not, however, differ
essentially, is proved by their susceptibility of being converted into
each other, by the addition or subtraction of a portion of hydrogen or
of carbon. The names of these acids are,</p>

<p>I have given you this summary account or enumeration of the acids, as
you may find it more satisfactory to have at once an outline or a
general notion of the extent of the subject; but we shall now confine
ourselves to the first class, which requires our more immediate
attention; and defer the few remarks which we shall have to make on the
others, till we treat of the chemistry of the animal and vegetable
kingdoms.</p>

<p>The acids of simple and known radicals are all capable of being
decomposed by combustible bodies, to which they yield their oxygen. If,
for instance, I&nbsp;pour a drop of sulphuric acid on this piece of
iron, it will produce a spot of rust, you know what that&nbsp;is?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<a name = "page76" id = "page76"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes; it is an oxyd, formed by the oxygen of the acid combining with
the iron.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>In this case you see the sulphur deposits the oxygen by which it was
acidified on the metal. And again, if we pour some acid on a compound
combustible substance, (we shall try it on this piece of wood,) it will
combine with one or more of the constituents of that substance, and
occasion a decomposition.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It has changed the colour of the wood to black. How is that?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The oxygen deposited by the acid has burnt it; you know that wood in
burning becomes black before it is reduced to ashes. Whether it derives
the oxygen which burns it from the atmosphere, or from any other source,
the chemical effect on the wood is the same. In the case of real
combustion, wood becomes black, because it is reduced to the state of
charcoal by the evaporation of its other constituents. But can you tell
me the reason why wood turns black when burnt by the application of an
acid?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<a name = "page77" id = "page77"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>First, tell me what are the ingredients of wood?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Hydrogen and carbon are the chief constituents of wood, as of all
other vegetable substances.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Well, then, I suppose that the oxygen of the acid combines with the
hydrogen of the wood, to form water; and that the carbon of the wood,
remaining alone, appears of its usual black colour.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well indeed, my dear; that is certainly the most plausible
explanation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Would not this be a good method of making charcoal?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It would be an extremely expensive, and, I&nbsp;believe, very
imperfect method; for the action of the acid on the wood, and the heat
produced by it, are far from sufficient to deprive the wood of all its
evaporable parts.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What is the reason that vinegar, lemon, and the acid of fruits, do
not produce this effect on wood?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
<a name = "page78" id = "page78"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They are vegetable acids, whose bases are composed of hydrogen and
carbon; the oxygen, therefore, will not be disposed to quit this
radical, where it is already united with hydrogen. The strongest of
these may, perhaps, yield a little of their oxygen to the wood, and
produce a stain upon it; but the carbon will not be sufficiently
uncovered to assume its black colour. Indeed, the several mineral acids
themselves possess this power of <ins class = "mycorr" title =
"text reads ‘charing’">charring</ins> wood in very different degrees.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Cannot vegetable acids be decomposed, by any combustibles?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; because their radical is composed of two substances which have a
greater attraction for oxygen than any known body.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And are those strong acids, which burn and decompose wood, capable of
producing similar effects on the skin and flesh of animals?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; all the mineral acids, and one of them more especially, possess
powerful caustic qualities. They actually corrode and destroy the
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<a name = "page79" id = "page79"> </a>
skin and flesh; but they do not produce upon these exactly the same
alteration they do on wood, probably because there is a great proportion
of nitrogen and other substances in animal matter, which prevents the
separation of carbon from being so conspicuous.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">I</span>n</span> addition to the general survey which we
have taken of acids, I&nbsp;think you will find it interesting to
examine individually a few of the most important of them, and likewise
some of their principal combinations with the alkalies, alkaline earths,
and metals. The first of the acids, in point of importance, is the <span
class = "smallroman">SULPHURIC</span>, formerly called <i>oil of
vitriol</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I have known it a long time by that name, but had no idea that it was
the same fluid as sulphuric acid. What resemblance or connection can
there be between oil of vitriol and this acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Vitriol is the common name for sulphat of iron, a&nbsp;salt which is
formed by the combination of sulphuric acid and iron; the sulphuric acid
was formerly
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<a name = "page81" id = "page81"> </a>
obtained by distillation from this salt, and it very naturally received
its name from the substance which afforded&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But it is still usually called oil of vitriol?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; a sufficient length of time has not yet elapsed, since the
invention of the new nomenclature, for it to be generally disseminated;
but, as it is adopted by all scientific chemists, there is every reason
to suppose that it will gradually become universal. When I received this
bottle from the chemists, <i>oil of vitriol</i> was inscribed on the
label; but, as I knew you were very punctilious in regard to the
nomenclature, I&nbsp;changed it, and substituted the words <i>sulphuric
acid</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This acid has neither colour nor smell, but it appears much thicker
than water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is nearly twice as heavy as water, and has, you see, an oily
consistence.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And it is probably from this circumstance that
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
<a name = "page82" id = "page82"> </a>
it has been called an oil, for it can have no real claim to that name,
as it does not contain either hydrogen or carbon, which are the
essential constituents of oil.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly; and therefore it would be the more absurd to retain a name
which owed its origin to such a mistaken analogy.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid, in its purest state, would probably be a concrete
substance, but its attraction for water is such, that it is impossible
to obtain that acid perfectly free from it; it is, therefore, always
seen in a liquid form, such as you here find it. One of the most
striking properties of sulphuric acid is that of evolving a considerable
quantity of heat when mixed with water; this I have already shown
you.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes, I recollect it; but what was the degree of heat produced by that
mixture?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The thermometer may be raised by it to 300 degrees, which is
considerably above the temperature of boiling water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Then water might be made to boil in that mixture?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
<a name = "page83" id = "page83"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Nothing more easy, provided that you employ sufficient quantities of
acid and of water, and in the due proportions. The greatest heat is
produced by a mixture of one part of water to four of the acid: we shall
make a mixture of these proportions, and immerse in it this thin glass
tube, which is full of water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The vessel feels extremely hot, but the water does not boil yet.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You must allow some time for the heat to penetrate the tube, and
raise the temperature of the water to the boiling point&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Now it boils&mdash;and with increasing violence.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But it will not continue boiling long; for the mixture gives out heat
only while the particles of the water and the acid are mutually
penetrating each other: as soon as the new arrangement of those
particles is effected, the mixture will gradually cool, and the water
return to its former temperature.</p>

<p>You have seen the manner in which sulphuric
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<a name = "page84" id = "page84"> </a>
acid decomposes all combustible substances, whether animal, vegetable,
or mineral, and burns them by means of its oxygen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I have very unintentionally repeated the experiment on my gown, by
letting a drop of the acid fall upon it, and it has made a stain, which,
I&nbsp;suppose, will never wash out.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No, certainly; for before you can put it into water, the spot will
become a hole, as the acid has literally burnt the muslin.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>So it has, indeed! Well, I will fasten the stopper, and put the
bottle away, for it is a dangerous substance.&mdash;Oh, now I have done
worse still, for I have spilt some on my hand!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is then burned, as well as your gown, for you know that oxygen
destroys animal as well as vegetable matters; and, as far as the
decomposition of the skin of your finger is effected, there is no
remedy; but by washing it immediately in water, you will dilute the
acid, and prevent any further injury.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
<a name = "page85" id = "page85"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It feels extremely hot, I assure you.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You have now learned, by experience, how cautiously this acid must be
used. You will soon become acquainted with another acid, the nitric,
which, though it produces less heat on the skin, destroys it still
quicker, and makes upon it an indelible stain. You should never handle
any substances of this kind, without previously dipping your fingers in
water, which will weaken their caustic effects. But, since you will not
repeat the experiment, I&nbsp;must put in the stopper, for the acid
attracts the moisture from the atmosphere, which would destroy its
strength and purity.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray, how can sulphuric acid be extracted from sulphat of iron by
distillation?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The process of distillation, you know, consists in separating
substances from one another by means of their different degrees of
volatility, and by the introduction of a new chemical agent, caloric.
Thus, if sulphat of iron be exposed in a retort to a proper degree of
heat, it will be decomposed, and the sulphuric acid will be
volatilised.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
<a name = "page86" id = "page86"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But now that the process of forming acids by the combustion of their
radicals is known, why should not this method be used for making
sulphuric acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This is actually done in most manufactures; but the usual method of
preparing sulphuric acid does not consist in burning the sulphur in
oxygen gas (as we formerly did by the way of experiment), but in heating
it together with another substance, nitre, which yields oxygen in
sufficient abundance to render the combustion in common air rapid and
complete.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This substance, then, answers the same purpose as oxygen gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Exactly. In manufactures the combustion is performed in a leaden
chamber, with water at the bottom, to receive the vapour and assist its
condensation. The combustion is, however, never so perfect but that a
quantity of <i>sulphureous</i> acid is formed at the same time; for you
recollect that the sulphureous acid, according to the chemical
nomenclature, differs from the sulphuric only by containing less
oxygen.</p>

<p>From its own powerful properties, and from the various combinations
into which it enters, sulphuric
<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
<a name = "page87" id = "page87"> </a>
acid is of great importance in many of the arts.</p>

<p>It is used also in medicine in a state of great dilution; for were it
taken internally, in a concentrated state, it would prove a most
dangerous poison.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I am sure it would burn the throat and stomach.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Can you think of any thing that would prove an antidote to this
poison?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>A large draught of water to dilute it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That would certainly weaken the caustic power of the acid, but it
would increase the heat to an intolerable degree. Do you recollect
nothing that would destroy its deleterious properties more
effectually?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>An alkali might, by combining with it; but, then, a&nbsp;pure alkali
is itself a poison, on account of its causticity.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There is no necessity that the alkali should be
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
<a name = "page88" id = "page88"> </a>
caustic. Soap, in which it is combined with oil; or magnesia, either in
the state of carbonat, or mixed with water, would prove the best
antidotes.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>In those cases then, I suppose, the potash and the magnesia would
quit their combinations to form salts with the sulphuric acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Precisely.</p>

<p>We may now make a few observations on the sulphure<i>ous</i> acid,
which we have found to be the product of sulphur slowly and imperfectly
burnt. This acid is distinguished by its pungent smell, and its gaseous
form.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Its aëriform state is, I suppose, owing to the smaller proportion of
oxygen, which renders it lighter than sulphur<i>ic</i> acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Probably; for by adding oxygen to the weaker acid, it may be
converted into the stronger kind. But this change of state may also be
connected with a change of affinity with regard to caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And may sulphureous acid be obtained from sulphuric acid by a
diminution of oxygen?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<a name = "page89" id = "page89"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; it can be done by bringing any combustible substance in contact
with the acid. This decomposition is most easily performed by some of
the metals; these absorb a portion of the oxygen from the sulphuric
acid, which is thus converted into the sulphureous, and flies off in its
gaseous form.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And cannot the sulphureous acid itself be decomposed and reduced to
sulphur?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; if this gas be heated in contact with charcoal, the oxygen of
the gas will combine with it, and the pure sulphur is regenerated.</p>

<p>Sulphureous acid is readily absorbed by water; and in this liquid
state it is found particularly useful in bleaching linen and woollen
cloths, and is much used in manufactures for those purposes. I&nbsp;can
show you its effect in destroying colours, by taking out vegetable
stains&mdash;I think I see a spot on your gown, Emily, on which we may
try the experiment.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It is the stain of mulberries; but I shall be almost afraid of
exposing my gown to the experiment, after seeing the effect which the
sulphuric acid produced on that of Caroline&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
<a name = "page90" id = "page90"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There is no such danger from the sulphureous; but the experiment must
be made with great caution, for, during the formation of sulphureous
acid by combustion, there is always some sulphuric produced.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But where is your sulphureous acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We may easily prepare some ourselves, simply by burning a match; we
must first wet the stain with water, and now hold it in this way, at a
little distance, over the lighted match: the vapour that arises from it
is sulphureous acid, and the stain, you see, gradually disappears.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I have frequently taken out stains by this means, without
understanding the nature of the process. But why is it necessary to wet
the stain before it is exposed to the acid fumes?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The moisture attracts and absorbs the sulphureous acid; and it serves
likewise to dilute any particles of sulphuric acid which might injure
the linen.</p>

<p>Sulphur is susceptible of a third combination
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
<a name = "page91" id = "page91"> </a>
with oxygen, in which the proportion of the latter is too small to
render the sulphur acid. It acquires this slight oxygenation by mere
exposure to the atmosphere, without any elevation of temperature: in
this case, the sulphur does not change its natural form, but is only
discoloured, being changed to red or brown; and in this state it is an
oxyd of sulphur.</p>

<p>Before we take leave of the sulphuric acid, we shall say a few words
of its principal combinations. It unites with all the alkalies, alkaline
earths and metals, to form compound salts.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Pray, give me leave to interrupt you for a moment: you have never
mentioned any other salts than the compound or neutral salts; is there
no other kind?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The term <i>salt</i> has been used, from time immemorial, as a kind
of general name for any substance that has savour, odour, is soluble in
water, and crystallisable, whether it be of an acid, an alkaline, or
compound nature; but the compound salts alone retain that appellation in
modern chemistry.</p>

<p>The most important of the salts, formed by the combinations of the
sulphuric acid, are, first, <i>sulphat of potash</i>, formerly called
<i>sal polychrest</i>: this
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
<a name = "page92" id = "page92"> </a>
is a very bitter salt, much used in medicine; it is found in the ashes
of most vegetables, but it may be prepared artificially by the immediate
combination of sulphuric acid and potash. This salt is easily soluble in
boiling water. Solubility is, indeed, a&nbsp;property common to all
salts; and they always produce cold in melting.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That must be owing to the caloric which they absorb in passing from a
solid to a fluid form.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is, certainly, the most probable explanation.</p>

<p><i>Sulphat of soda</i>, commonly called Glauber’s salt, is another
medicinal salt, which is still more bitter than the preceding. We must
prepare some of these compounds, that you may observe the phenomena
which take place during their formation. We need only pour some
sulphuric acid over the soda which I have put into this glass.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What an amazing heat is disengaged!&mdash;I thought you said that
cold was produced by the melting of salts?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But you must observe that we are now <i>making</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
<a name = "page93" id = "page93"> </a>
not <i>melting</i> a salt. Heat is disengaged during the formation of
compound salts, and a faint light is also emitted, which may sometimes
be perceived in the dark.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And is this heat and light produced by the union of the opposite
electricities of the alkali and the acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No doubt it is, if that theory be true.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The union of an acid and an alkali is then an actual combustion?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not precisely, though there is certainly much analogy in these
processes.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Will this sulphat of soda become solid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We have not, I suppose, mixed the acid and the alkali in the exact
proportions that are required for the formation of the salt, otherwise
the mixture would have been almost immediately changed to a solid mass;
but, in order to obtain it in crystals, as you see it in this bottle, it
would be necessary first to dilute it with water, and afterwards
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
<a name = "page94" id = "page94"> </a>
to evaporate the water, during which operation the salt would gradually
crystallise.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But of what use is the addition of water, if it is afterwards to be
evaporated?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>When suspended in water, the acid and the alkali are more at liberty
to act on each other, their union is more complete, and the salt assumes
the regular form of crystals during the slow evaporation of its
solvent.</p>

<p>Sulphat of soda liquefies by heat, and effloresces in the air.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray what is the meaning of the word <i>effloresces</i>? I&nbsp;do
not recollect your having mentioned it before.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>A salt is said to effloresce when it loses its water of
crystallisation on being exposed to the atmosphere, and is thus
gradually converted into a dry powder: you may observe that these
crystals of sulphat of soda are far from possessing the transparency
which belongs to their crystalline state; they are covered with a white
powder, occasioned by their having been exposed to the atmosphere, which
has deprived their surface of its lustre, by
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
<a name = "page95" id = "page95"> </a>
absorbing its water of crystallisation. Salts are, in general, either
<i>efflorescent</i> or <i>deliquescent</i>: this latter property is
precisely the reverse of the former; that is to say, deliquescent salts
absorb water from the atmosphere, and are moistened and gradually melted
by it. Muriat of lime is an instance of great deliquescence.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But are there no salts that have the same degree of attraction for
water as the atmosphere, and that will consequently not be affected
by&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; there are many such salts, as, for instance, common salt,
sulphat of magnesia, and a variety of others.</p>

<p><i>Sulphat of lime</i> is very frequently met with in nature, and
constitutes the well-known substance called <i>gypsum</i>, or <i>plaster
of Paris</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sulphat of magnesia</i>, commonly called <i>Epsom salt</i>, is
another very bitter medicine, which is obtained from sea-water and from
several springs, or may be prepared by the direct combination of its
ingredients.</p>

<p>We have formerly mentioned <i>sulphat of alumine</i> as constituting
the common <i>alum</i>; it is found in nature chiefly in the
neighbourhood of volcanos, and is particularly useful in the arts, from
its
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<a name = "page96" id = "page96"> </a>
strong astringent qualities. It is chiefly employed by dyers and
calico-printers, to fix colours; and is used also in the manufacture of
some kinds of leather.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid combines also with the metals.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>One of these combinations, <i>sulphat of iron</i>, we are already
well acquainted with.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is the most important metallic salt formed by sulphuric acid,
and the only one that we shall here notice. It is of great use in the
arts; and, in medicine, it affords a very valuable tonic: it is of this
salt that most of those preparations called <i>steel medicines</i> are
composed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But does any carbon enter into these compositions to form steel?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not an atom: they are, therefore, very improperly called steel: but
it is the vulgar appellation, and medical men themselves often comply
with the general custom.</p>

<p>Sulphat of iron may be prepared, as you have seen, by dissolving iron
in sulphuric acid; but it
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
<a name = "page97" id = "page97"> </a>
is generally obtained from the natural production called <i>Pyrites</i>,
which being a sulphuret of iron, requires only exposure to the
atmosphere to be oxydated, in order to form the salt; this, therefore,
is much the most easy way of procuring it on a large scale.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I am surprised to find that both acids and compound salts are
generally obtained from their various combinations, rather than from the
immediate union of their ingredients.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Were the simple bodies always at hand, their combinations would
naturally be the most convenient method of forming compounds; but you
must consider that, in most instances, there is great difficulty and
expense in obtaining the simple ingredients from their combinations; it
is, therefore, often more expedient to procure compounds from the
decomposition of other compounds. But, to return to the sulphat of
iron.&mdash;There is a certain vegetable acid called <i>Gallic acid</i>,
which has the remarkable property of precipitating this salt
black&mdash;I&nbsp;shall pour a few drops of the gallic acid into this
solution of sulphat of iron&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is become as black as ink!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
<a name = "page98" id = "page98"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And it is ink in reality. Common writing ink is a precipitate of
sulphat of iron by gallic acid; the black colour is owing to the
formation of gallat of iron, which being insoluble, remains suspended in
the fluid.</p>

<p>This acid has also the property of altering the colour of iron in its
metallic state. You may frequently see its effect on the blade of a
knife, that has been used to cut certain kinds of fruits.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>True; and that is, perhaps, the reason that a silver knife is
preferred to cut fruits; the gallic acid, I&nbsp;suppose, does not act
upon silver.&mdash;Is this acid found in all fruits?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is contained, more or less, in the rind of most fruits and roots,
especially the radish, which, if scraped with a steel or iron knife, has
its bright red colour changed to a deep purple, the knife being at the
same time blackened. But the vegetable substance in which the gallic
acid most abounds is <i>nutgall</i>, a&nbsp;kind of excrescence that
grows on oaks, and from which the acid is commonly obtained for its
various purposes.</p>

<p>We now come to the <span class = "smallroman">PHOSPHORIC</span> and
<span class = "smallroman">PHOSPHOROUS ACIDS</span>. In treating of
phosphorus, you have seen how these acids may be obtained from it by
combustion?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes; but I should be much surprised if it was the usual method of
obtaining them, since it is so very difficult to procure phosphorus in
its pure state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You are right, my dear; the phosphoric acid, for general purposes, is
extracted from bones, in which it is contained in the state of phosphat
of lime; from this salt the phosphoric acid is separated by means of the
sulphuric, which combines with the lime. In its pure state, phosphoric
acid is either liquid or solid, according to its degree of
concentration.</p>

<p>Among the salts formed by this acid, <i>phosphat of lime</i> is the
only one that affords much interest; and this, we have already observed,
constitutes the basis of all bones. It is also found in very small
quantities in some vegetables.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Why so, Mrs. B.?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because you have long known its radical, which is nitrogen or azote;
and in treating of that element, I&nbsp;did not even hint that it was
the basis of an acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And what could be your reason for not <ins class = "mycorr" title =

sooner?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I do not know whether you will think the reason
<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<a name = "page101" id = "page101"> </a>
sufficiently good to acquit me; but the omission, I&nbsp;assure you, did
not proceed from negligence. You may recollect that nitrogen was one of
the first simple bodies which we examined; you were then ignorant of the
theory of combustion, which I believe was, for the first time, mentioned
in that lesson; and therefore it would have been in vain, at that time,
to have attempted to explain the nature and formation of acids.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I wonder, however, that it never occurred to us to enquire whether
nitrogen could be acidified; for, as we knew it was classed among the
combustible bodies, it was natural to suppose that it might produce an
acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is not a necessary consequence; for it might combine with oxygen
only in the degree requisite to form an oxyd. But you will find that
nitrogen is susceptible of various degrees of oxygenation, some of which
convert it merely into an oxyd, and others give it all the acid
properties.</p>

<p>The acids, resulting from the combination of oxygen and nitrogen, are
called the <span class = "smallroman">NITROUS</span> and <span class =
"smallroman">NITRIC</span> acids. We will begin with the <span class =
"smallroman">NITRIC</span>, in which nitrogen is in the highest state of
oxygenation. This acid naturally exists in the form of
<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
<a name = "page102" id = "page102"> </a>
gas; but is so very soluble in water, and has so great an affinity for
it, that one grain of water will absorb and condense ten grains of acid
gas, and form the limpid fluid which you see in this bottle.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What a strong offensive smell it has!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This acid contains a greater abundance of oxygen than any other, but
it retains it with very little force.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Then it must be a powerful caustic, both from the facility with which
it parts with its oxygen, and the quantity which it affords?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well, Emily; both cause and effect are exactly such as you
describe: nitric acid burns and destroys all kinds of organised matter.
It even sets fire to some of the most combustible substances.&mdash;We
shall pour a little of it over this piece of dry warm charcoal&mdash;you
see it inflames it immediately; it would do the same with oil of
turpentine, phosphorus, and several other very combustible bodies. This
shows you how easily this acid is decomposed by combustible bodies,
<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
<a name = "page103" id = "page103"> </a>
since these effects must depend upon the absorption of its oxygen.</p>

<p>Nitric acid has been used in the arts from time immemorial, but it is
only within these twenty-five years that its chemical nature has been
ascertained. The celebrated Mr. Cavendish discovered that it consisted
of about 10 parts of nitrogen and 25 of oxygen.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag23" id = "tag23" href = "#note23">*</a> These principles, in their
gaseous state, combine at a high temperature; and this may be effected
by repeatedly passing the electrical spark through a mixture of the two
gases.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The nitrogen and oxygen gases, of which the atmosphere is composed,
do not combine, I&nbsp;suppose, because their temperature is not
sufficiently elevated?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But in a thunder-storm, when the lightning repeatedly passes through
them, may it not produce nitric acid? We should be in a strange
situation, if a violent storm should at once convert the atmosphere into
nitric acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There is no danger of it, my dear; the lightning can affect but a
very small portion of the atmosphere,
<span class = "pagenum">104</span>
<a name = "page104" id = "page104"> </a>
and though it were occasionally to produce a little nitric acid, yet
this never could happen to such an extent as to be perceivable.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But how could the nitric acid be known, and used, before the method
of combining its constituents was discovered?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Before that period the nitric acid was obtained, and it is indeed
still extracted, for the common purposes of art, from the compound salt
which it forms with potash, commonly called <i>nitre</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Why is it so called? Pray, Mrs. B., let these old unmeaning names be
entirely given up, by us at least; and let us call this salt <i>nitrat
of potash</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>With all my heart; but it is necessary that I should, at least,
mention the old names, and more especially those which are yet in common
use; otherwise, when you meet with them, you would not be able to
understand their meaning.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And how is the acid obtained from this salt?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
<a name = "page105" id = "page105"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By the intervention of sulphuric acid, which combines with the
potash, and sets the nitric acid at liberty. This I can easily show you,
by mixing some nitrat of potash and sulphuric acid in this retort, and
heating it over a lamp; the nitric acid will come over in the form of
vapour, which we shall collect in a glass bell. This acid, diluted in
water, is commonly called <i>aqua fortis</i>, if Caroline will allow me
to mention that name.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I have often heard that aqua fortis will dissolve almost all metals;
it is no doubt because it yields its oxygen so easily.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; and from this powerful solvent property, it derived the name of
aqua fortis, or strong water. Do you not recollect that we oxydated, and
afterwards dissolved, some copper in this acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>If I remember right, the nitrat of copper was the first instance you
gave us of a compound salt.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Can the nitric acid be completely decomposed and converted into
nitrogen and oxygen?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<a name = "page106" id = "page106"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That cannot be the case, Caroline; since the acid can be decomposed
only by the combination of its constituents with other bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>True; but caloric is sufficient for this purpose. By making the acid
pass through a red hot porcelain tube, it is decomposed; the nitrogen
and oxygen regain the caloric which they had lost in combining, and are
thus both restored to their gaseous state.</p>

<p>The nitric acid may also be partly decomposed, and is by this means
converted into <span class = "smallroman">NITROUS ACID</span>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This conversion must be easily effected, as the oxygen is so slightly
combined with the nitrogen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The partial decomposition of nitric acid is readily effected by most
metals; but it is sufficient to expose the nitric acid to a very strong
light to make it give out oxygen gas, and thus be converted into nitrous
acid. Of this acid there are various degrees, according to the
proportions of oxygen which it contains; the strongest, and that into
which the nitric is first converted, is of a yellow colour, as you see
in this bottle.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
<a name = "page107" id = "page107"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How it fumes when the stopper is taken out!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The acid exists naturally in a gaseous state, and is here so strongly
concentrated in water, that it is constantly escaping.</p>

<p>Here is another bottle of nitrous acid, which, you see, is of an
orange red; this acid is weaker, the nitrogen being combined with a
smaller quantity of oxygen; and with a still less proportion of oxygen
it is an olive-green colour, as it appears in this third bottle. In
short, the weaker the acid, the deeper is its colour.</p>

<p>Nitrous acid acts still more powerfully on some inflammable
substances than the nitric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I am surprised at that, as it contains less oxygen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, it parts with its oxygen much more readily:
you may recollect that we once inflamed oil with this acid.</p>

<p>The next combinations of nitrogen and oxygen form only oxyds of
nitrogen, the first of which is commonly called <i>nitrous air</i>; or
more properly <i>nitric oxyd gas</i>. This may be obtained from nitric
acid, by exposing the latter to the action of metals,
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<a name = "page108" id = "page108"> </a>
as in dissolving them it does not yield the whole of its oxygen, but
retains a portion of this principle sufficient to convert it into this
peculiar gas, a&nbsp;specimen of which I have prepared, and preserved
within this inverted glass bell.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It is a perfectly invisible elastic fluid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; and it may be kept any length of time in this manner over water,
as it is not, like the nitric and nitrous acids, absorbable by it. It is
rather heavier than atmospherical air, and is incapable of supporting
either combustion or respiration. I&nbsp;am going to incline the glass
gently on one side, so as to let some of the gas escape&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>How very curious!&mdash;It produces orange fumes like the nitrous
acid! that is the more extraordinary, as the gas within the glass is
perfectly invisible.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It would give me much pleasure if you could make out the reason of
this curious change without requiring any further explanation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It seems, by the colour and smell, as if it were
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
<a name = "page109" id = "page109"> </a>
converted into nitrous acid gas: yet that cannot be, unless it combines
with more oxygen; and how can it obtain oxygen the very instant it
escapes from the glass?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>From the atmosphere, no doubt. Is it not so, Mrs.&nbsp;B.?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You have guessed it; as soon as it comes in contact with the
atmosphere, it absorbs from it the additional quantity of oxygen
necessary to convert it into nitrous acid gas. And, if I now remove the
bottle entirely from the water, so as to bring at once the whole of the
gas into contact with the atmosphere, this conversion will appear still
more striking&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Look, Caroline, the whole capacity of the bottle is instantly tinged
of an orange colour!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Thus, you see, it is the most easy process imaginable to convert
<i>nitrous oxyd gas</i> into <i>nitrous acid gas</i>. The property of
attracting oxygen from the atmosphere, without any elevation of
temperature, has occasioned this gaseous oxyd being used as a test for
ascertaining the degree
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
<a name = "page110" id = "page110"> </a>
of purity of the atmosphere. I&nbsp;am going to show you how it is
applied to this purpose.&mdash;You see this graduated glass tube, which
is closed at one end, (<a class = "smallcaps" href =
"Conver1.html#plateXb">Plate X.</a> Fig.&nbsp;2.)&mdash;I&nbsp;first
fill it with water, and then introduce a certain measure of nitrous gas,
which, not being absorbable by water, passes through it, and occupies
the upper part of the tube. I&nbsp;must now add rather above two-thirds
of oxygen gas, which will just be sufficient to convert the nitrous oxyd
gas into nitrous acid gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>So it has!&mdash;I saw it turn of an orange colour; but it
immediately afterwards disappeared entirely, and the water, you see, has
risen, and almost filled the tube.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is because the acid gas is absorbable by water, and in
proportion as the gas impregnates the water, the latter rises in the
tube. When the oxygen gas is very pure, and the required proportion of
nitrous oxyd gas very exact, the whole is absorbed by the water; but if
any other gas be mixed with the oxygen, instead of combining with the
nitrous oxygen, it will remain and occupy the upper part of the tube;
or, if the gases be not in the due proportion, there will be a residue
of that which predominates.&mdash;Before we leave this
<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
<a name = "page111" id = "page111"> </a>
subject, I&nbsp;must not forget to remark that nitrous acid may be
formed by dissolving nitrous oxyd gas in nitric acid. This solution may
be effected simply by making bubbles of nitrous oxyd gas pass through
nitric acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That is to say, that nitrogen at its highest degree of oxygenation,
being mixed with nitrogen at its lowest degree of oxygenation, will
produce a kind of intermediate substance, which is nitrous acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You have stated the fact with great precision.&mdash;There are
various other methods of preparing nitrous oxyd, and of obtaining it
from compound bodies; but it is not necessary to enter into these
particulars. It remains for me only to mention another curious
modification of oxygenated nitrogen, which has been distinguished by the
name of <i>gaseous oxyd of nitrogen</i>. It is but lately that this gas
has been accurately examined, and its properties have been investigated
chiefly by Sir H. Davy. It has obtained also the name of
<i>exhilarating</i> gas, from the very singular property which that
gentleman has discovered in it, of elevating the animal spirits, when
inhaled into the lungs, to a degree sometimes resembling delirium or
intoxication.</p>

<p>Is it respirable, then?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be called respirable, as it would not support life
for any length of time; but it may be breathed for a few moments without
any other effects, than the singular exhilaration of spirits I have just
mentioned. It affects different people, however, in a very different
manner. Some become violent, even outrageous: others experience a
languor, attended with faintness; but most agree in opinion, that the
sensations it excites are extremely pleasant.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I think I should like to try it&mdash;how do you breathe&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By collecting the gas in a bladder, to which a short tube with a
stop-cock is adapted; this is applied to the mouth with one hand, whilst
the nostrils are kept closed with the other, that the common air may
have no access. You then alternately inspire, and expire the gas, till
you perceive its effects. But I cannot consent to your making the
experiment; for the nerves are sometimes unpleasantly affected by it,
and I would not run any risk of that kind.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
<a name = "page113" id = "page113"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I should like, at least, to see somebody breathe it; but pray by what
means is this curious gas obtained?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is procured from <i>nitrat of ammonia</i>, an artificial salt
which yields this gas on the application of a gentle heat. I&nbsp;have
put some of the salt into a retort, and by the aid of a lamp the gas
will be extricated.&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Bubbles of air begin to escape through the neck of the retort into
the water apparatus; will you not collect them?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The gas that first comes over need not be preserved, as it consists
of little more than the common air that was in the retort; besides,
there is always in this experiment a quantity of watery vapour which
must come away before the nitrous oxyd appears.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Watery vapour! Whence does that proceed? There is no water in nitrat
of ammonia?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You must recollect that there is in every salt a quantity of water of
crystallisation, which may
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
<a name = "page114" id = "page114"> </a>
be evaporated by heat alone. But, besides this, water is actually
generated in this experiment, as you will see presently. First tell me,
what are the constituent parts of nitrat of ammonia?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Ammonia, and nitric acid: this salt, therefore, contains three
different elements, nitrogen and hydrogen, which produce the ammonia;
and oxygen, which, with nitrogen, forms the acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Well then, in this process the ammonia is decomposed; the hydrogen
quits the nitrogen to combine with some of the oxygen of the nitric
acid, and forms with it the watery vapour which is now coming over. When
that is effected, what will you expect to find?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Nitrous acid instead of nitric acid, and nitrogen instead of
ammonia.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Exactly so; and the nitrous acid and nitrogen combine, and form the
gaseous oxyd of nitrogen, in which the proportion of oxygen is 37 parts
to 63 of nitrogen.</p>

<p>You may have observed, that for a little while
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
<a name = "page115" id = "page115"> </a>
no bubbles of air have come over, and we have perceived only a stream of
vapour condensing as it issued into the water.&mdash;Now bubbles of air
again make their appearance, and I imagine that by this time all the
watery vapour is come away, and that we may begin to collect the gas. We
may try whether it is pure, by filling a phial with it, and plunging a
taper into it&mdash;yes, it will do now, for the taper burns brighter
than in the common air, and with a greenish flame.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But how is that? I thought no gas would support combustion but oxygen
or chlorine.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Or any gas that contains oxygen, and is ready to yield it, which is
the case with this in a considerable degree; it is not, therefore,
surprising that it should accelerate the combustion of the taper.</p>

<p>You see that the gas is now produced in great abundance; we shall
collect a large quantity of it, and I dare say that we shall find some
of the family who will be curious to make the experiment of respiring
it. Whilst this process is going on, we may take a general survey of the
most important combinations of the nitric and nitrous acids with the
alkalies.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
<a name = "page116" id = "page116"> </a>
<p>The first of these is <i>nitrat of potash</i>, commonly called
<i>nitre</i> or <i>saltpetre</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is not that the salt with which gunpowder is made?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes. Gunpowder is a mixture of five parts of nitre to one of sulphur,
and one of charcoal.&mdash;Nitre from its great proportion of oxygen,
and from the facility with which it yields it, is the basis of most
detonating compositions.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But what is the cause of the violent detonation of gunpowder when set
fire&nbsp;to?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Detonation may proceed from two causes; the sudden formation or
destruction of an elastic fluid. In the first case, when either a solid
or liquid is instantaneously converted into an elastic fluid, the
prodigious and sudden expansion of the body strikes the air with great
violence, and this concussion produces the sound called detonation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That I comprehend very well; but how can a similar effect be produced
by the destruction of a gas?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
<a name = "page117" id = "page117"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>A gas can be destroyed only by condensing it to a liquid or solid
state; when this takes place suddenly, the gas, in assuming a new and
more compact form, produces a vacuum, into which the surrounding air
rushes with great impetuosity; and it is by that rapid and violent
motion that the sound is produced. In all detonations, therefore, gases
are either suddenly formed, or destroyed. In that of gunpowder, can you
tell me which of these two circumstances takes place?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>As gunpowder is a solid, it must, of course, produce the gases in its
detonation; but how, I&nbsp;cannot tell.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The constituents of gunpowder, when heated to a certain degree, enter
into a number of new combinations, and are instantaneously converted
into a variety of gases, the sudden expansion of which gives rise to the
detonation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And in what instance does the destruction or condensation of gases
produce detonation?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I can give you one with which you are well
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
<a name = "page118" id = "page118"> </a>
acquainted; the sudden combination of the oxygen and hydrogen gases.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>True; I recollect perfectly that hydrogen detonates with oxygen when
the two gases are converted into water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But let us return to the nitrat of potash.&mdash;This salt is
decomposed when exposed to heat, and mixed with any combustible body,
such as carbon, sulphur, or metals, these substances oxydating rapidly
at the expense of the nitrat. I&nbsp;must show you an instance of
this.&mdash;I&nbsp;expose to the fire some of the salt in a small iron
ladle, and, when it is sufficiently heated, add to it some powdered
charcoal; this will attract the oxygen from the salt, and be converted
into carbonic acid.&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But what occasions that crackling noise, and those vivid flashes that
accompany&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which the carbonic acid gas is formed occasions a
succession of small detonations, which, together with the emission of
flame, is called <i>deflagration</i>.</p>

<p><i>Nitrat of ammonia</i> we have already noticed,
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
<a name = "page119" id = "page119"> </a>
on account of the gaseous oxyd of nitrogen which is obtained
from&nbsp;it.</p>

<p><i>Nitrat of silver</i> is the lunar caustic, so remarkable for its
property of destroying animal fibre, for which purpose it is often used
by surgeons.&mdash;We have said so much on a former occasion, on the
mode in which caustics act on animal matter, that I shall not detain you
any longer on this subject.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/dec_line.png" width = "99" height = "8"

</p>

<p>We now come to the <span class = "smallroman">CARBONIC ACID</span>,
which we have already had many opportunities of noticing. You recollect
that this acid may be formed by the combustion of carbon, whether in its
imperfect state of charcoal, or in its purest form of diamond. And it is
not necessary, for this purpose, to burn the carbon in oxygen gas, as we
did in the preceding lecture; for you need only light a piece of
charcoal and suspend it under a receiver on the water bath. The charcoal
will soon be extinguished, and the air in the receiver will be found
mixed with carbonic acid. The process, however, is much more expeditious
if the combustion be performed in pure oxygen gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But how can you separate the carbonic acid,
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
<a name = "page120" id = "page120"> </a>
obtained in this manner, from the air with which it is mixed?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The readiest mode is to introduce under the receiver a quantity of
caustic lime, or caustic alkali, which soon attracts the whole of the
carbonic acid to form a carbonat.&mdash;The alkali is found increased in
weight, and the volume of the air is diminished by a quantity equal to
that of the carbonic acid which was mixed with&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray is there no method of obtaining pure carbon from carbonic
acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>For a long time it was supposed that carbonic acid was not
decompoundable; but Mr. Tennant discovered, a&nbsp;few years ago, that
this acid may be decomposed by burning phosphorus in a closed vessel
with carbonat of soda or carbonat of lime: the phosphorus absorbs the
oxygen from the carbonat, whilst the carbon is separated in the form of
a black powder. This decomposition, however, is not effected simply by
the attraction of the phosphorus for oxygen, since it is weaker than
that of charcoal; but the attraction of the alkali of lime for the
phosphoric acid, unites its power at the same time.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">121</span>
<a name = "page121" id = "page121"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Cannot we make that experiment?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not easily; it requires being performed with extreme nicety, in order
to obtain any sensible quantity of carbon, and the experiment is much
too delicate for me to attempt it. But there can be no doubt of the
accuracy of Mr. Tennant’s results; and all chemists now agree, that one
hundred parts of carbonic acid gas consists of about twenty-eight parts
of carbon to seventy-two of oxygen gas. But if you recollect, we
decomposed carbonic acid gas the other day by burning potassium
in&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>True, so we did; and found the carbon precipitated on the regenerated
potash.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid gas is found very abundantly in nature; it is supposed
to form about one thousandth part of the atmosphere, and is constantly
produced by the respiration of animals; it exists in a great variety of
combinations, and is exhaled from many natural decompositions. It is
contained in a state of great purity in certain caves, such as the
<i>Grotto del Cane</i>, near Naples.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
<a name = "page122" id = "page122"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I recollect having read an account of that grotto, and of the cruel
experiments made on the poor dogs, to gratify the curiosity of
strangers. But I understood that the vapour exhaled by this cave was
called <i>fixed air</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is the name by which carbonic acid was known before its chemical
composition was discovered.&mdash;This gas is more destructive of life
than any other; and if the poor animals that are submitted to its
effects are not plunged into cold water as soon as they become
senseless, they do not recover. It extinguishes flame instantaneously.
I&nbsp;have collected some in this glass, which I will pour over the
candle.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This is extremely singular&mdash;it seems to extinguish it as it were
by enchantment, as the gas is invisible. I&nbsp;never should have
imagined that gas could have been poured like a liquid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It can be done with carbonic acid only, as no other gas is
sufficiently heavy to be susceptible of being poured out in the
atmospherical air without mixing with&nbsp;it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
<a name = "page123" id = "page123"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray by what means did you obtain this gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I procured it from marble. Carbonic acid gas has so strong an
attraction for all the alkalies and alkaline earths, that these are
always found in nature in the state of carbonats. Combined with lime,
this acid forms chalk, which may be considered as the basis of all kinds
of marbles, and calcareous stones. From these substances carbonic acid
is easily separated, as it adheres so slightly to its combinations, that
the carbonats are all decomposable by any of the other acids. I&nbsp;can
easily show you how I obtained this gas; I&nbsp;poured some diluted
sulphuric acid over pulverised marble in this bottle (the same which we
used the other day to prepare hydrogen gas), and the gas escaped through
the tube connected with it; the operation still continues, as you may
easily perceive&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes, it does; there is a great fermentation in the glass vessel. What
singular commotion is excited by the sulphuric acid taking possession of
the lime, and driving out the carbonic acid!</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But did the carbonic acid exist in a gaseous state in the marble?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
<a name = "page124" id = "page124"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly not; the acid, when in a state of combination, is capable
of existing in a solid form.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Whence, then, does it obtain the caloric necessary to convert it into
gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It may be supplied in this case from the mixture of sulphuric acid
and water, which produces an evolution of heat, even greater than is
required for the purpose; since, as you may perceive by touching the
glass vessel, a&nbsp;considerable quantity of the caloric disengaged
becomes sensible. But a supply of caloric may be obtained also from a
diminution of capacity for heat, occasioned by the new combination which
takes place; and, indeed, this must be the case when other acids are
employed for the disengagement of carbonic acid gas, which do not, like
the sulphuric, produce heat on being mixed with water. Carbonic acid may
likewise be disengaged from its combinations by heat alone, which
restores it to its gaseous state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It appears to me very extraordinary that the same gas, which is
produced by the burning of wood and coals, should exist also in such
bodies
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<a name = "page125" id = "page125"> </a>
as marble, and chalk, which are incombustible substances.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I will not answer that objection, Caroline, because I think I can put
you in a way of doing it yourself. Is carbonic acid combustible?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Why, no&mdash;because it is a body that has been already burnt; it is
carbon only, and not the acid, that is combustible.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Well, and what inference do you draw from this?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That carbonic acid cannot render the bodies with which it is united
combustible; but that simple carbon does, and that it is in this
elementary state that it exists in wood, coals, and a great variety of
other combustible bodies.&mdash;Indeed, Mrs.&nbsp;B., you are very
ungenerous; you are not satisfied with convincing me that my objections
are frivolous, but you oblige me to prove them so myself.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You must confess, however, that I make ample amends for the detection
of error, when I enable
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
<a name = "page126" id = "page126"> </a>
you to discover the truth. <ins class = "correction" title = "all commas in original">You,
understand, now,</ins> I&nbsp;hope, that carbonic acid
is equally produced by the decomposition of chalk, or by the combustion
of charcoal. These processes are certainly of a very different nature;
in the first case the acid is already formed, and requires nothing more
than heat to restore it to its gaseous state; whilst, in the latter, the
acid is actually made by the process of combustion.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I understand it now perfectly. But I have just been thinking of
another difficulty, which, I&nbsp;hope, you will excuse my not being
able to remove myself. How does the immense quantity of calcareous
earth, which is spread all over the globe, obtain the carbonic acid with
which it is combined?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The question is, indeed, not very easy to answer; but I conceive that
the general carbonisation of calcareous matter may have been the effect
of a general combustion, occasioned by some revolution of our globe, and
producing an immense supply of carbonic acid, with which the calcareous
matter became impregnated; or that this may have been effected by a
gradual absorption of carbonic acid from the atmosphere.&mdash;But this
would lead us to discussions which we cannot indulge
<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
<a name = "page127" id = "page127"> </a>
in, without deviating too much from our subject.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>How does it happen that we do not perceive the pernicious effects of
the carbonic acid which is floating in the atmosphere?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because of the state of very great dilution in which it exists there.
But can you tell me, Emily, what are the sources which keep the
atmosphere constantly supplied with this acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I suppose the combustion of wood, coals, and other substances, that
contain carbon.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And also the breath of animals.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The breath of animals! I thought you said that this gas was not at
all respirable, but on the contrary, extremely poisonous.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>So it is; but although animals cannot breathe in carbonic acid gas,
yet, in the process of respiration, they have the power of forming this
gas in
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
<a name = "page128" id = "page128"> </a>
their lungs; so that the air which we <i>expire</i>, or reject from the
lungs, always contains a certain proportion of carbonic acid, which is
much greater than that which is commonly found in the atmosphere.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But what is it that renders carbonic acid such a deadly poison?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The manner in which this gas destroys life, seems to be merely by
preventing the access of respirable air; for carbonic acid gas, unless
very much diluted with common air, does not penetrate into the lungs, as
the windpipe actually contracts and refuses it admittance.&mdash;But we
must dismiss this subject at present, as we shall have an opportunity of
treating of respiration much more fully, when we come to the chemical
functions of animals.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is carbonic acid as destructive to the life of vegetables as it is to
that of animals?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>If a vegetable be completely immersed in it, I&nbsp;believe it
generally proves fatal to it; but mixed in certain proportions with
atmospherical air, it is, on the contrary, very favourable to
vegetation.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
<a name = "page129" id = "page129"> </a>
<p>You remember, I suppose, our mentioning the mineral waters, both
natural and artificial, which contain carbonic acid gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>You mean the Seltzer water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is one of those which are the most used; there are, however,
a&nbsp;variety of others into which carbonic acid enters as an
ingredient: all these waters are usually distinguished by the name of
<i>acidulous</i> or <i>gaseous mineral waters</i>.</p>

<p>The class of salts called <i>carbonats</i> is the most numerous in
nature; we must pass over them in a very cursory manner, as the subject
is far too extensive for us to enter on it in detail. The state of
carbonat is the natural state of a vast number of minerals, and
particularly of the alkalies and alkaline earths, as they have so great
an attraction for the carbonic acid, that they are almost always found
combined with it; and you may recollect that it is only by separating
them from this acid, that they acquire that causticity and those
striking qualities which I have formerly described. All marbles, chalks,
shells, calcareous spars, and lime-stones of every description, are
neutral salts, in which <i>lime</i>, their common basis, has lost all
its characteristic properties.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">130</span>
<a name = "page130" id = "page130"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But if all these various substances are formed by the union of lime
with carbonic acid, whence arises their diversity of form and
appearance?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Both from the different proportions of their component parts, and
from a variety of foreign ingredients which may be occasionally blended
with them: the veins and colours of marbles, for instance, proceed from
a mixture of metallic substances; silex and alumine also frequently
enter into these combinations. The various carbonats, therefore, that I
have enumerated, cannot be considered as pure unadulterated neutral
salts, although they certainly belong to that class of bodies.</p>

<p>Sir H. Davy succeeded in decomposing the boracic acid, (which had
till then been considered as undecompoundable,) by various methods. On
exposing this acid to the Voltaic battery, the positive wire gave out
oxygen, and on the negative wire was deposited a black substance, in
appearance resembling charcoal. This was the basis of the acid, which
Sir H. Davy has called <i>Boracium</i>, or <i>Boron</i>.</p>

<p>The same substance was obtained in more considerable quantities, by
exposing the acid to a great heat in an iron gun-barrel.</p>

<p>A third method of decomposing the boracic acid consisted in burning
potassium in contact with it in vacuo. The potassium attracts the oxygen
from the acid, and leaves its basis in a separate state.</p>

<p>The recomposition of this acid I shall show
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
<a name = "page133" id = "page133"> </a>
you, by burning some of its basis, which you see here, in a retort full
of oxygen gas. The heat of a candle is all that is required for this
combustion.&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The light is astonishingly brilliant, and what beautiful sparks it
throws out!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The result of this combustion is the boracic acid, the nature of
which, you see, is proved both by analytic and synthetic means. Its
basis has not, it is true, a&nbsp;metallic appearance; but it makes very
hard alloys with other metals.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But pray, Mrs. B., for what purpose is the boracic acid used in
manufactures?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Its principal use is in conjunction with soda, that is, in the state
of <i>borat of soda</i>, which in the arts is commonly called borax.
This salt has a peculiar power of dissolving metallic oxyds, and of
promoting the fusion of substances capable of being melted; it is
accordingly employed in various metallic arts; it is used, for example,
to remove the oxyd from the surface of metals, and
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
<a name = "page134" id = "page134"> </a>
is often employed in the assaying of metallic ores.</p>


<p class = "space">
Let us now proceed to the <span class = "smallroman">FLUORIC
ACID</span>. This acid is obtained from a substance which is found
frequently in mines, and particularly in those of Derbyshire, called
<i>fluor</i>, a&nbsp;name which it acquired from the circumstance of its
being used to render the ores of metals more fluid when heated.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Pray is not this the Derbyshire spar, of which so many ornaments are
made?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The same; but though it has long been employed for a variety of
purposes, its nature was unknown until Scheele, the great Swedish
chemist, discovered that it consisted of lime united with a peculiar
acid, which obtained the name of <i>fluoric acid</i>. It is easily
separated from the lime by the sulphuric acid, and unless condensed in
water, ascends in the form of gas. A&nbsp;very peculiar property of this
acid is its union with siliceous earths, which I have already mentioned.
If the distillation of this acid is performed in glass vessels, they are
corroded, and the siliceous part of the glass comes over, united with
the gas; if water
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
<a name = "page135" id = "page135"> </a>
is then admitted, part of the silex is deposited, as you may observe in
this jar.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I see white flakes forming on the surface of the water; is that
silex?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes it is. This power of corroding glass has been used for engraving,
or rather etching, upon it. The glass is first covered with a coat of
wax, through which the figures to be engraved are to be scratched with a
pin; then pouring the fluoric acid over the wax, it corrodes the glass
where the scratches have been made.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I should like to have a bottle of this acid, to make engravings.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But you could not have it in a <i>glass</i> bottle, for in that case
the acid would be saturated with silex, and incapable of executing an
engraving; the same thing would happen were the acid kept in vessels of
porcelain or earthen-ware; this acid must therefore be both prepared and
preserved in vessels of silver.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
<a name = "page136" id = "page136"> </a>
<p>If it be distilled from fluor spar and vitriolic acid, in silver or
leaden vessels, the receiver being kept very cold during the
distillation, it assumes the form of a dense fluid, and in that state is
the most intensely corrosive substance known. This seems to be the acid
combined with a little water. It may be called <i>hydro-fluoric
acid</i>; and Sir H. Davy has been led, from some late experiments on
the subject, to consider <i>pure</i> fluoric acid as a compound of a
certain unknown principle, which he calls <i>fluorine</i>, with
hydrogen.</p>

<p>Sir H. Davy has also attempted to decompose the fluoric acid by
burning potassium in contact with it; but he has not yet been able by
this or any other method, to obtain its basis in a distinct separate
state.</p>


<p class = "space">
We shall conclude our account of the acids with that of the <span class
= "smallroman">MURIATIC ACID</span>, which is perhaps the most curious
and interesting of all of them. It is found in nature combined with
soda, lime, and magnesia. <i>Muriat of soda</i> is the common sea-salt,
and from this substance the acid is usually disengaged by means of the
sulphuric acid. The natural state of the muriatic acid is that of an
invisible permanent gas, at the common temperature of the atmosphere;
but it has a remarkably strong attraction for water, and assumes
<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<a name = "page137" id = "page137"> </a>
the form of a whitish cloud whenever it meets any moisture to combine
with. This acid is remarkable for its peculiar and very pungent smell,
and possesses, in a powerful degree, most of the acid properties. Here
is a bottle containing muriatic acid in a liquid state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And how is it liquefied?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By impregnating water with it; its strong attraction for water makes
it very easy to obtain it in a liquid form. Now, if I open the phial,
you may observe a kind of vapour rising from it, which is muriatic acid
gas, of itself invisible, but made apparent by combining with the
moisture of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Have you not any of the pure muriatic acid gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This jar is full of that acid in its gaseous state&mdash;it is
inverted over mercury instead of water, because, being absorbable by
water, this gas cannot be confined by it.&mdash;I&nbsp;shall now raise
the jar a little on one side, and suffer some of the gas to
<span class = "pagenum">138</span>
<a name = "page138" id = "page138"> </a>
escape.&mdash;You see that it immediately becomes visible in the form of
a cloud.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It must be, no doubt, from its uniting with the moisture of the
atmosphere, that it is converted into this dewy vapour.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly; and for the same reason, that is to say, its extreme
eagerness to unite with water, this gas will cause snow to melt as
rapidly as an intense fire.</p>

<p>This acid proved much more refractory when Sir H. Davy attempted to
decompose it than the other two undecompounded acids. It is singular
that potassium will burn in muriatic acid, and be converted into potash,
without decomposing the acid, and the result of this combustion is a
<i>muriat of potash</i>; for the potash, as soon as it is regenerated,
combines with the muriatic acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But how can the potash be regenerated if the muriatic acid does not
oxydate the potassium?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The potassium, in this process, obtains oxygen from the moisture with
which the muriatic acid is
<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
<a name = "page139" id = "page139"> </a>
always combined, and accordingly hydrogen, resulting from the
decomposition of the moisture, is invariably evolved.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But why not make these experiments with dry muriatic acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Dry acids cannot be acted on by the Voltaic battery, because acids
are non-conductors of electricity, unless moistened. In the course of a
number of experiments which Sir H. Davy made upon acids in a state of
dryness, he observed that the presence of water appeared always
necessary to develop the acid properties, so that acids are not even
capable of reddening vegetable blues if they have been carefully
deprived of moisture. This remarkable circumstance led him to suspect,
that water, instead of oxygen, may be the acidifying principle; but this
he threw out rather as a conjecture than as an established point.</p>

<p>Sir H. Davy obtained very curious results from burning potassium in a
mixture of phosphorus and muriatic acid, and also of sulphur and
muriatic acid; the latter detonates with great violence. All his
experiments, however, failed in presenting to his view the basis of the
muriatic acid, of which he was in search; and he was at last induced to
<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
<a name = "page140" id = "page140"> </a>
form an opinion respecting the nature of this acid, which I shall
presently explain.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is this acid susceptible of different degrees of oxygenation?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, for though we cannot deoxygenate this acid, yet we may add
oxygen to&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Why, then, is not the least degree of oxygenation of the acid called
the <i>muriatous</i>, and the higher degree the <i>muriatic</i>
acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because, instead of becoming, like other acids, more dense, and more
acid by an addition of oxygen, it is rendered on the contrary more
volatile, more pungent, but less acid, and less absorbable by water.
These circumstances, therefore, seem to indicate the propriety of making
an exception to the nomenclature. The highest degree of oxygenation of
this acid has been distinguished by the additional epithet of
<i>oxygenated</i>, or, for the sake of brevity, <i>oxy</i>, so that it
is called the <i>oxygenated</i>, or <i>oxy-muriatic acid</i>. This
likewise exists in a gaseous form, at the temperature of the atmosphere;
it is also susceptible of being absorbed
<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
<a name = "page141" id = "page141"> </a>
by water, and can be congealed, or solidified, by a certain degree of
cold.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And how do you obtain the oxy-muriatic acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>In various ways; but it may be most conveniently obtained by
distilling liquid muriatic acid over oxyd of manganese, which supplies
the acid with the additional oxygen. One part of the acid being put into
a retort, with two parts of the oxyd of manganese, and the heat of a
lamp applied, the gas is soon disengaged, and may be received over
water, as it is but sparingly absorbed by it.&mdash;I&nbsp;have
collected some in this jar&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is not invisible, like the generality of gases; for it is of a
yellowish colour.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The muriatic acid extinguishes flame, whilst, on the contrary, the
oxy-muriatic makes the flame larger, and gives it a dark red colour. Can
you account for this difference in the two acids?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes, I think so; the muriatic acid will not supply
<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
<a name = "page142" id = "page142"> </a>
the flame with the oxygen necessary for its support; but when this acid
is further oxygenated, it will part with its additional quantity of
oxygen, and in this way support combustion.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is exactly the case; indeed the oxygen added to the muriatic
acid, adheres so slightly to it, that it is separated by mere exposure
to the sun’s rays. This acid is decomposed also by combustible bodies,
many of which it burns, and actually inflames, without any previous
increase of temperature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That is extraordinary, indeed! I hope you mean to indulge us with
some of these experiments?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I have prepared several glass jars of oxy-muriatic acid gas for that
purpose. In the first we shall introduce some Dutch gold leaf.&mdash;Do
you observe that it takes fire?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed it does&mdash;how wonderful it is! It became immediately
red hot, but was soon smothered in a thick vapour.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What a disagreeable smell!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
<a name = "page143" id = "page143"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We shall try the same experiment with phosphorus in another jar of
this acid.&mdash;You had better keep your handkerchief to your nose when
I open it&mdash;now let us drop into it this little piece of
phosphorus&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It burns really; and almost as brilliantly as in oxygen gas! But,
what is most extraordinary, these combustions take place without the
metal or phosphorus being previously lighted, or even in the least
heated.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>All these curious effects are owing to the very great facility with
which this acid yields oxygen to such bodies as are strongly disposed to
combine with it. It appears extraordinary indeed to see bodies, and
metals in particular, melted down and inflamed, by a gas without any
increase of temperature, either of the gas, or of the combustible. The
phenomenon, however, is, you see, well accounted for.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Why did you burn a piece of Dutch gold leaf rather than a piece of
any other metal?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because, in the first place, it is a composition
<span class = "pagenum">144</span>
<a name = "page144" id = "page144"> </a>
of metals (consisting chiefly of copper) which burns readily; and I use
a thin metallic leaf in preference to a lump of metal, because it offers
to the action of the gas but a small quantity of matter under a large
surface. Filings, or shavings, would answer the purpose nearly as well;
but a lump of metal, though the surface would oxydate with great
rapidity, would not take fire. Pure gold is not inflamed by oxy-muriatic
acid gas, but it is rapidly oxydated, and dissolved by it; indeed, this
acid is the only one that will dissolve gold.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This, I suppose, is what is commonly called <i>aqua regia</i>, which
you know is the only thing that will act upon gold.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is not exactly the case either; for aqua regia is composed of a
mixture of muriatic acid and nitric acid.&mdash;But, in fact, the result
of this mixture is the formation of oxy-muriatic acid, as the muriatic
acid oxygenates itself at the expence of the nitric; this mixture,
therefore, though it bears the name of <i>nitro-muriatic acid</i>, acts
on gold merely in virtue of the oxy-muriatic acid which it contains.</p>

<p>Sulphur, volatile oils, and many other substances, will burn in the
same manner in oxy-muriatic
<span class = "pagenum">145</span>
<a name = "page145" id = "page145"> </a>
acid gas; but I have not prepared a sufficient quantity of it, to show
you the combustion of all these bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>There are several jars of the gas yet remaining.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We must reserve these for future experiments. The oxy-muriatic acid
does not, like other acids, redden the blue vegetable colours; but it
totally destroys any colour, and turns all vegetables perfectly white.
Let us collect some vegetable substances to put into this glass, which
is full of gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Here is a sprig of myrtle&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And here some coloured paper&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We shall also put in this piece of scarlet riband, and a
rose&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Their colours begin to fade immediately! But how does the gas produce
this effect?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The oxygen combines with the colouring matter of these substances,
and destroys it; that is to
<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
<a name = "page146" id = "page146"> </a>
say, destroys the property which these colours had of reflecting only
one kind of rays, and renders them capable of reflecting them all,
which, you know, will make them appear white. Old prints may be cleaned
by this acid, for the paper will be whitened without injury to the
impression, as printer’s ink is made of materials (oil and lamp black)
which are not acted upon by acids.</p>

<p>This property of the oxy-muriatic acid has lately been employed in
manufactures in a variety of bleaching processes; but for these purposes
the gas must be dissolved in water, as the acid is thus rendered much
milder and less powerful in its effects; for, in a gaseous state, it
would destroy the texture, as well as the colour of the substance
submitted to its action.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Look at the things which we put into the gas; they have now entirely
lost their colour!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The effect of the acid is almost completed; and, if we were to
examine the quantity that remains, we should find it to consist chiefly
of muriatic acid.</p>

<p>The oxy-muriatic acid has been used to purify the air in fever
hospitals and prisons, as it burns and destroys putrid effluvia of every
kind. The
<span class = "pagenum">147</span>
<a name = "page147" id = "page147"> </a>
infection of the small-pox is likewise destroyed by this gas, and matter
that has been submitted to its influence will no longer generate that
disorder.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Indeed, I think the remedy must be nearly as bad as the disease; the
oxy-muriatic acid has such a dreadfully suffocating smell.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is certainly extremely offensive; but by keeping the mouth shut,
and wetting the nostrils with liquid ammonia, in order to neutralize the
vapour as it reaches the nose, its prejudicial effects may be in some
degree prevented. At any rate, however, this mode of disinfection can
hardly be used in places that are inhabited. And as the vapour of nitric
acid, which is scarcely less efficacious for this purpose, is not at all
prejudicial, it is usually preferred on such occasions.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>You have not told us yet what is Sir H. Davy’s new opinion respecting
the nature of muriatic acid, to which you alluded a few minutes ago?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>True; I avoided noticing it then, because you could not have
understood it without some previous
<span class = "pagenum">148</span>
<a name = "page148" id = "page148"> </a>
knowledge of the oxy-muriatic acid, which I have but just introduced to
your acquaintance.</p>

<p>Sir H. Davy’s idea is that muriatic acid, instead of being a
compound, consisting of an unknown basis and oxygen, is formed by the
union of oxy-muriatic gas with hydrogen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Have you not told us just now that oxy-muriatic gas was itself a
compound of muriatic acid and oxygen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but according to Sir H. Davy’s hypothesis, oxy-muriatic gas is
considered as a simple body, which contains no oxygen&mdash;as a
substance of its own kind, which has a great analogy to oxygen in most
of its properties, though in others it differs entirely from
it.&mdash;According to this view of the subject, the name of
<i>oxy-muriatic acid</i> can no longer be proper, and therefore Sir H.
Davy has adopted that of <i>chlorine</i>, or <i>chlorine gas</i>,
a&nbsp;name which is simply expressive of its greenish colour; and in
compliance with that philosopher’s theory, we have placed chlorine in
our table among the simple bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But what was Sir H. Davy’s reason for adopting an opinion so contrary
to that which had hitherto prevailed?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">149</span>
<a name = "page149" id = "page149"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There are many circumstances which are favourable to the new
doctrine; but the clearest and simplest fact in its support is, that if
hydrogen gas and oxy-muriatic gas be mixed together, both these gases
disappear, and muriatic acid gas is formed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That seems to be a complete proof; is it not considered as perfectly
conclusive?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not so decisive as it appears at first sight; because it is argued by
those who still incline to the old doctrine, that muriatic acid gas,
however dry it may be, always contains a certain quantity of water,
which is supposed essential to its formation. So that, in the experiment
just mentioned, this water is supplied by the union of the hydrogen gas
with the oxygen of the oxy-muriatic acid; and therefore the mixture
resolves itself into the base of muriatic acid and water, that is,
muriatic acid gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I think the old theory must be the true one; for otherwise how could
you explain the formation of oxy-muriatic gas, from a mixture of
muriatic acid and oxyd of manganese?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">150</span>
<a name = "page150" id = "page150"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very easily; you need only suppose that in this process the muriatic
acid is decomposed; its hydrogen unites with the oxygen of the manganese
to form water, and the chlorine appears in its separate state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But how can you explain the various combustions which take place in
oxy-muriatic gas, if you consider it as containing no oxygen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We need only suppose that combustion is the result of intense
chemical action; so that chlorine, like oxygen, in combining with
bodies, forms compounds which have less capacity for caloric than their
constituent principles, and, therefore, caloric is evolved at the moment
of their combination.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>If, then, we may explain every thing by either theory, to which of
the two shall we give the preference?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It will, perhaps, be better to wait for more positive proofs, if such
can be obtained, before we decide positively upon the subject. The new
doctrine has certainly gained ground very rapidly, and may be considered
as nearly established; but several
<span class = "pagenum">151</span>
<a name = "page151" id = "page151"> </a>
competent judges still refuse their assent to it, and until that theory
is very generally adopted, it may be as well for us still occasionally
to use the language to which chemists have long been
accustomed.&mdash;But let us proceed to the examination of salts formed
by muriatic acid.</p>

<p>Among the compound salts formed by muriatic acid, the <i>muriat of
soda</i>, or common salt, is the most interesting.<a class = "tag" name
= "tag24" id = "tag24" href = "#note24">*</a> The uses and properties of
this salt are too well known to require much comment. Besides the
pleasant flavour it imparts to the food, it is very wholesome, when not
used to excess, as it assists the process of digestion.</p>

<p>Sea-water is the great source from which muriat of soda is extracted
by evaporation. But it is also found in large solid masses in the bowels
of the earth, in England, and in many other parts of the world.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I thought that salts, when solid, were always in the state of
crystals; but the common table-salt is in the form of a coarse white
powder.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">152</span>
<a name = "page152" id = "page152"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Crystallisation depends, as you may recollect, on the slow and
regular reunion of particles dissolved in a fluid; common sea-salt is
only in a state of imperfect crystallisation, because the process by
which it is prepared is not favourable to the formation of regular
crystals. But if you dissolve it, and afterwards evaporate the water
slowly, you will obtain a regular crystallisation.</p>

<p><i>Muriat of ammonia</i> is another combination of this acid, which
we have already mentioned as the principal source from which ammonia is
derived.</p>

<p>I can at once show you the formation of this salt by the immediate
combination of muriatic acid with ammonia.&mdash;These two glass jars
contain, the one muriatic acid gas, the other ammoniacal gas, both of
which are perfectly invisible&mdash;now, if I mix them together, you see
they immediately form an opake white cloud, like smoke.&mdash;If a
thermometer was placed in the jar in which these gases are mixed, you
would perceive that some heat is at the same time produced.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The effects of chemical combinations are, indeed,
wonderful!&mdash;How extraordinary it is that two invisible bodies
should become visible by their union!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">153</span>
<a name = "page153" id = "page153"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This strikes you with astonishment, because it is a phenomenon which
nature seldom exhibits to our view; but the most common of her
operations are as wonderful, and it is their frequency only that
prevents our regarding them with equal admiration. What would be more
surprising, for instance, than combustion, were it not rendered so
familiar by custom?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That is true.&mdash;But pray, Mrs. B., is this white cloud the salt
that produces ammonia? How different it is from the solid muriat of
ammonia which you once showed&nbsp;us!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is the same substance which first appears in the state of vapour,
but will soon be condensed by cooling against the sides of the jar, in
the form of very minute crystals.</p>

<p>We may now proceed to the <i>oxy-muriats</i>. In this class of salts
the <i>oxy-muriat of potash</i> is the most worthy of our attention, for
its striking properties. The acid, in this state of combination,
contains a still greater proportion of oxygen than when alone.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But how can the oxy-muriatic acid acquire an increase of oxygen by
combining with potash?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">154</span>
<a name = "page154" id = "page154"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It does not really acquire an additional quantity of oxygen, but it
loses some of the muriatic acid, which produces the same effect, as the
acid which remains is proportionably super-oxygenated.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag25" id = "tag25" href = "#note25">*</a></p>

<p>If this salt be mixed, and merely rubbed together with sulphur,
phosphorus, charcoal, or indeed any other combustible, it explodes
strongly.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Like gun-powder, I suppose, it is suddenly converted into elastic
fluids?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but with this remarkable difference, that no increase of
temperature, any further than is produced by gentle friction, is
required in this instance. Can you tell me what gases are generated by
the detonation of this salt with charcoal?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Let me consider . . . . . The oxy-muriatic acid parts with its excess
of oxygen to the charcoal, by which means it is converted into muriatic
acid gas; whilst the charcoal, being burnt by the oxygen, is
<span class = "pagenum">155</span>
<a name = "page155" id = "page155"> </a>
changed to carbonic acid gas.&mdash;What becomes of the potash I cannot
tell.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is a fixed product which remains in the vessel.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But since the potash does not enter into the new combinations,
I&nbsp;do not understand of what use it is in this operation. Would not
the oxy-muriatic acid and the charcoal produce the same effect
without&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; because there would not be that very great concentration of
oxygen which the combination with the potash produces, as I have just
explained.</p>

<p>I mean to show you this experiment, but I would advise you not to
repeat it alone; for if care be not taken to mix only very small
quantities at a time, the detonation will be extremely violent, and may
be attended with dangerous effects. You see I mix an exceedingly small
quantity of the salt with a little powdered charcoal, in this Wedgwood
mortar, and rub them together with the pestle&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Heavens! How can such a loud explosion be produced by so small a
quantity of matter?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">156</span>
<a name = "page156" id = "page156"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You must consider that an extremely small quantity of solid substance
may produce a very great volume of gases; and it is the sudden evolution
of these which occasions the sound.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Would not oxy-muriat of potash make stronger gunpowder than nitrat of
potash?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but the preparation, as well as the use of this salt, is
attended with so much danger, that it is never employed for that
purpose.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>There is no cause to regret it, I think; for the common gunpowder is
quite sufficiently destructive.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I can show you a very curious experiment with this salt; but it must
again be on condition that you will never attempt to repeat it by
yourselves. I&nbsp;throw a small piece of phosphorus into this glass of
water; then a little oxy-muriat of potash; and, lastly, I&nbsp;pour in
(by means of this funnel, so as to bring it in contact with the two
other ingredients at the bottom of the glass) a&nbsp;small quantity of
sulphuric acid&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
<a name = "page157" id = "page157"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This is, indeed, a beautiful experiment! The phosphorus takes fire
and burns from the bottom of the water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>How wonderful it is to see flame bursting out under water, and rising
through it! Pray, how is this accounted for?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Cannot you find it out, Caroline?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Stop&mdash;I think I can explain it. Is it not because the sulphuric
acid decomposes the salt by combining with the potash, so as to liberate
the oxy-muriatic acid gas by which the phosphoric is set on fire?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well, Emily; and with a little more reflection you would have
discovered another concurring circumstance, which is, that an increase
of temperature is produced by the mixture of the sulphuric acid and
water, which assists in promoting the combustion of the phosphorus.</p>


<p class = "space">
I must, before we part, introduce to your acquaintance the
newly-discovered substance <span class = "smallroman">IODINE</span>,
which you may recollect we placed next to oxygen and chlorine in our
table of simple bodies.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">158</span>
<a name = "page158" id = "page158"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is this also a body capable of maintaining combustion like oxygen and
chlorine?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is; and although it does not so generally disengage light and heat
from inflammable bodies, as oxygen and chlorine do, yet it is capable of
combining with most of them; and sometimes, as in the instance of
potassium and phosphorus, the combination is attended with an actual
appearance of light and heat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But what sort of a substance is iodine: what is its form, and
colour?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is a very singular body, in many respects. At the ordinary
temperature of the atmosphere, it commonly appears in the form of
blueish black crystalline scales, such as you see in this tube.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>They shine like black lead, and some of the scales have the shape of
lozenges.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is actually the form which the crystals of iodine often assume.
But if we heat them gently,
<span class = "pagenum">159</span>
<a name = "page159" id = "page159"> </a>
by holding the tube over the flame of a candle, see what a change takes
place in them.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How curious! They seem to melt, and the tube immediately fills with a
beautiful violet vapour. But look, Mrs.&nbsp;B., the same scales are now
appearing at the other end of the tube.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This is in fact a sublimation of iodine, from one part of the tube to
another; but with this remarkable peculiarity, that, while in the
gaseous state, iodine assumes that bright violet colour, which, as you
may already perceive, it loses as the tube cools, and the substance
resumes its usual solid form.&mdash;It is from the violet colour of the
gas that iodine has obtained its name.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But how is this curious substance obtained?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is found in the ley of ashes of sea-weeds, after the soda has been
separated by crystallisation; and it is disengaged by means of sulphuric
acid, which expels it from the alkaline ley in the form of a violet gas,
which may be collected and condensed in the way you have just
<span class = "pagenum">160</span>
<a name = "page160" id = "page160"> </a>
seen.&mdash;This interesting discovery was made in the year 1812, by M.
Courtois, a&nbsp;manufacturer of saltpetre at Paris.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And pray, Mrs. B., what is the proof of iodine being a simple
body?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is considered as a simple body, both because it is not capable of
being resolved into other ingredients; and because it is itself capable
of combining with other bodies, in a manner analogous to oxygen and
chlorine. The most curious of these combinations is that which it forms
with hydrogen gas, the result of which is a peculiar gaseous acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Just as chlorine and hydrogen gas form muriatic acid? In this respect
chlorine and iodine seem to bear a strong analogy to each other.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is indeed the case; so that if the theory of the constitution of
either of these two bodies be true, it must be true also in regard to
the other; if erroneous in the one, the theory must fall in both.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">161</span>
<a name = "page161" id = "page161"> </a>
<p>But it is now time to conclude; we have examined such of the acids
and salts as I conceived would appear to you most
interesting.&mdash;I&nbsp;shall not enter into any particulars
respecting the metallic acids, as they offer nothing sufficiently
striking for our present purpose.</p>

According to Sir H. Davy’s views of the nature of the muriatic and
oxy-muriatic acids, dry muriat of soda is a compound of sodium and
chlorine, for it may be formed by the direct combination of oxy-muriatic
gas and sodium. In his opinion, therefore, what we commonly call muriat
of soda contains neither soda nor muriatic acid.</p>

class of compounds, that of <span class = "smallroman">ORGANISED
BODIES</span>, which will furnish us with a new source of instruction
and amusement.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>By organised bodies, I suppose, you mean the vegetable and animal
creation? I&nbsp;have, however, but a very vague idea of the word
<i>organisation</i>, and I have often wished to know more precisely what
it means.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">163</span>
<a name = "page163" id = "page163"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Organised bodies are such as are endowed by nature with various
parts, peculiarly constructed and adapted to perform certain functions
connected with life. Thus you may observe, that mineral compounds are
formed by the simple effect of mechanical or chemical attraction, and
may appear to some to be in a great measure the productions of chance;
whilst organised bodies bear the most striking and impressive marks of
design, and are eminently distinguished by that unknown principle,
called <i>life</i>, from which the various organs derive the power of
exercising their respective functions.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But in what manner does life enable these organs to perform their
several functions?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is a mystery which, I fear, is enveloped in such profound
darkness that there is very little hope of our ever being able to unfold
it. We must content ourselves with examining the effects of this
principle; as for the cause, we have been able only to give it a name,
without attaching any other meaning to it than the vague and
unsatisfactory idea of au unknown agent.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">164</span>
<a name = "page164" id = "page164"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And yet I think I can form a very clear idea of life.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Pray let me hear how you would define it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is perhaps more easy to conceive than to express&mdash;let me

assigned to them?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I have nothing to object to your definition; but you will allow me to
observe, that you have only mentioned the effects which the unknown
cause produces, without giving us any notion of the cause itself.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes, Caroline, you have told us what life <i>does</i>, but you have
not told us what it <i>is</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We may study its operations, but we should puzzle ourselves to no

<p>We shall begin with examining its effects in the
<span class = "pagenum">165</span>
<a name = "page165" id = "page165"> </a>
vegetable world, which constitutes the simplest class of organised
bodies; these we shall find distinguished from the mineral creation, not
only by their more complicated nature, but by the power which they
possess within themselves, of forming new chemical arrangements of their
constituent parts, by means of appropriate organs. Thus, though all
vegetables are ultimately composed of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen,
(with a few other occasional ingredients,) they separate and combine
these principles by their various organs, in a thousand ways, and form,
with them, different kinds of juices and solid parts, which exist ready
made in vegetables, and may, therefore, be considered as their immediate
materials.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What a long list of names! I did not suppose
<span class = "pagenum">166</span>
<a name = "page166" id = "page166"> </a>
that a vegetable was composed of half so many ingredients.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You must not imagine that every one of these materials is formed in
each individual plant. I&nbsp;only mean to say, that they are all
derived exclusively from the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But does each particular part of the plant, such as the root, the
bark, the stem, the seeds, the leaves, consist of one of these
ingredients only, or of several of them combined together?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I believe there is no part of a plant which can be said to consist
solely of any one particular ingredient; a&nbsp;certain number of
vegetable materials must always be combined for the formation of any
particular part, (of a seed for instance,) and these combinations are
carried on by sets of vessels, or minute organs, which select from other
parts, and bring together, the several principles required for the
development and growth of those particular parts which they are intended
to form and to maintain.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And are not these combinations always regulated by the laws of
chemical attraction?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">167</span>
<a name = "page167" id = "page167"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No doubt; the organs of plants cannot force principles to combine
that have no attraction for each other; nor can they compel superior
attractions to yield to those of inferior power; they probably act
rather mechanically, by bringing into contact such principles, and in
such proportions, as will, by their chemical combination, form the
various vegetable products.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>We may then consider each of these organs as a curiously constructed
apparatus, adapted for the performance of a variety of chemical
processes.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Exactly so. As long as the plant lives and thrives, the carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen, (the chief constituents of its immediate
materials,) are so balanced and connected together, that they are not
susceptible of entering into other combinations; but no sooner does
death take place, than this state of equilibrium is destroyed, and new
combinations produced.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But why should death destroy it; for these principles must remain in
the same proportions, and consequently, I&nbsp;should suppose, in the
same order of attractions?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">168</span>
<a name = "page168" id = "page168"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You must remember, that in the vegetable, as well as in the animal
kingdom, it is by the principle of <i>life</i> that the organs are
enabled to act; when deprived of that agent or stimulus, their power
ceases, and an order of attractions succeeds similar to that which would
take place in mineral or unorganised matter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It is this new order of attractions, I suppose, that destroys the
organisation of the plant after death; for if the same combinations
still continued to prevail, the plant would always remain in the state
in which it died?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And that, you know, is never the case; plants may be partially
preserved for some time after death, by drying; but in the natural
course of events they all return to the state of simple elements;
a&nbsp;wise and admirable dispensation of Providence, by which dead
plants are rendered fit to enrich the soil, and become subservient to
the nourishment of living vegetables.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But we are talking of the dissolution of plants, before we have
examined them in their living state.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">169</span>
<a name = "page169" id = "page169"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is true, my dear. But I wished to give you a general idea of the
nature of vegetation, before we entered into particulars. Besides, it is
not so irrelevant as you suppose to talk of vegetables in their dead
state, since we cannot analyse them without destroying life; and it is
only by hastening to submit them to examination, immediately after they
have ceased to live, that we can anticipate their natural decomposition.
There are two kinds of analysis of which vegetables are susceptible;
first, that which separates them into their immediate materials, such as
sap, resin, mucilage, &amp;c.; secondly, that which decomposes them into
their primitive elements, as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is there not a third kind of analysis of plants, which consists in
separating their various parts, as the stem, the leaves, and the several
organs of the flower?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That, my dear, is rather the department of the botanist; we shall
consider these different parts of plants only, as the organs by which
the various secretions or separations are performed; but we must first
examine the nature of these secretions.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">170</span>
<a name = "page170" id = "page170"> </a>
<p>The <i>sap</i> is the principal material of vegetables, since it
contains the ingredients that nourish every part of the plant. The basis
of this juice, which the roots suck up from the soil, is water; this
holds in solution the various other ingredients required by the several
parts of the plant, which are gradually secreted from the sap by the
different organs appropriated to that purpose, as it passes them in
circulating through the plant.</p>


<p class = "space">
<i>Mucus</i>, or <i>mucilage</i>, is a vegetable substance, which, like
all the others, is secreted from the sap; when in excess, it exudes from
trees in the form of gum.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is that the gum so frequently used instead of paste or glue?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is; almost all fruit-trees yield some sort of gum, but that most
commonly used in the arts is obtained from a species of acacia-tree in
Arabia, and is called <i>gum arabic</i>; it forms the chief nourishment
of the natives of those parts, who obtain it in great quantities from
incisions which they make in the trees.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I did not know that gum was eatable.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">171</span>
<a name = "page171" id = "page171"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There is an account of a whole ship’s company being saved from
starving by feeding on the cargo, which was gum senegal. I&nbsp;should
not, however, imagine, that it would be either a pleasant or a
particularly eligible diet to those who have not, from their birth, been
accustomed to it. It is, however, frequently taken medicinally, and
considered as very nourishing. Several kinds of vegetable acids may be
obtained, by particular processes, from gum or mucilage, the principal
of which is called the <i>mucous acid</i>.</p>


<p class = "space">
<i>Sugar</i> is not found in its simple state in plants, but is always
mixed with gum, sap, or other ingredients; this saccharine matter is to
be met with in every vegetable, but abounds most in roots, fruits, and
particularly in the sugar-cane.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>If all vegetables contain sugar, why is it extracted exclusively from
the sugar-cane?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because it is both most abundant in that plant, and most easily
obtained from it. Besides, the sugars produced by other vegetables
differ a little in their nature.</p>

<a name = "page172" id = "page172"> </a>
<p>During the late troubles in the West-Indies, when Europe was but
imperfectly supplied with sugar, several attempts were made to extract
it from other vegetables, and very good sugar was obtained from parsnips
and from carrots; but the process was too expensive to carry this
enterprize to any extent.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I should think that sugar might be more easily obtained from sweet
fruits, such as figs, dates,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Probably; but it would be still more expensive, from the high price
of those fruits.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray, in what manner is sugar obtained from the sugar-cane?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The juice of this plant is first expressed by passing it between two
cylinders of iron. It is then boiled with lime-water, which makes a
thick scum rise to the surface. The clarified liquor is let off below
and evaporated to a very small quantity, after which it is suffered to
crystallise by standing in a vessel, the bottom of which is perforated
<span class = "pagenum">173</span>
<a name = "page173" id = "page173"> </a>
with holes, that are imperfectly stopped, in order that the syrup may
drain off. The sugar obtained by this process is a coarse brown powder,
commonly called raw or moist sugar; it undergoes another operation to be
refined and converted into loaf sugar. For this purpose it is dissolved
in water, and afterwards purified by an animal fluid called albumen.
White of eggs chiefly consist of this fluid, which is also one of the
constituent parts of blood; and consequently eggs, or bullocks’ blood,
are commonly used for this purpose.</p>

<p>The albuminous fluid being diffused through the syrup, combines with
all the solid impurities contained in it, and rises with them to the
surface, where it forms a thick scum; the clear liquor is then again
evaporated to a proper consistence, and poured into moulds, in which, by
a confused crystallisation, it forms loaf-sugar. But an additional
process is required to whiten it; to this effect the mould is inverted,
and its open base is covered with clay, through which water is made to
pass; the water slowly trickling through the sugar, combines with and
carries off the colouring matter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I am very glad to hear that the blood that is used to purify sugar
does not remain in it; it would be a disgusting idea. I&nbsp;have heard
of some
<span class = "pagenum">174</span>

<p>It would be much too long to give you an account of the process in
detail. But the principal improvement relates to the mode of evaporating
the syrup, in order to bring it to the consistency of sugar. Instead of
boiling the syrup in a large copper, over a strong fire, Mr. Howard
carries off the water by means of a large air-pump, in a way similar to
that used in Mr. Leslie’s experiment for freezing water by evaporation;
that is, the syrup being exposed to a vacuum, the water evaporates
quickly, with no greater heat than that of a little steam, which is
introduced round the boiler. The air-pump is of course of large
dimensions, and is worked by a steam engine. A&nbsp;great saving is thus
obtained, and a striking instance afforded of the power of science in
suggesting useful economical improvements.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And pray how is sugar-candy and barley-sugar prepared?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Candied sugar is nothing more than the regular crystals, obtained by
slow evaporation from a solution of sugar. Barley-sugar is sugar melted
by
<span class = "pagenum">175</span>
<a name = "page175" id = "page175"> </a>
heat, and afterwards cooled in moulds of a spiral form.</p>

<p>Sugar may be decomposed by a red heat, and, like all other vegetable
substances, resolved into carbonic acid and hydrogen. The formation and
the decomposition of sugar afford many very interesting particulars,
which we shall fully examine, after having gone through the other
materials of vegetables. We shall find that there is reason to suppose
that sugar is not, like the other materials, secreted from the sap by
appropriate organs; but that it is formed by a peculiar process with
which you are not yet acquainted.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Pray, is not honey of the same nature as sugar?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Honey is a mixture of saccharine matter and gum.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I thought that honey was in some measure an animal substance, as it
is prepared by the bees.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is rather collected by them from flowers, and conveyed to their
store-houses, the hives. It is the wax only that undergoes a real
alteration in
<span class = "pagenum">176</span>
<a name = "page176" id = "page176"> </a>
the body of the bee, and is thence converted into an animal
substance.</p>

<p>Manna is another kind of sugar, which is united with a nauseous
extractive matter, to which it owes its peculiar taste and colour. It
exudes like gum from various trees in hot climates, some of which have
their leaves glazed by&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The next of the vegetable materials is <i>fecula</i>; this is the
general name given to the farinaceous substance contained in all seeds,
and in some roots, as the potatoe, parsnip, &amp;c. It is intended by
nature for the first aliment of the young vegetable; but that of one
particular grain is become a favourite and most common food of a large
part of mankind.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>You allude, I suppose, to bread, which is made of wheat-flower?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes. The fecula of wheat contains also another vegetable substance
which seems peculiar to that seed, or at least has not as yet been
obtained from any other. This is <i>gluten</i>, which is of a sticky,
ropy, elastic nature; and it is supposed to be owing to the viscous
qualities of this substance, that wheat-flour forms a much better paste
than any other.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">177</span>
<a name = "page177" id = "page177"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Gluten, by your description, must be very like gum?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>In their sticky nature they certainly have some resemblance; but
gluten is essentially different from gum in other points, and especially
in its being insoluble in water, whilst gum, you know, is extremely
soluble.</p>

<p>The <i>oils</i> contained in vegetables all consist of hydrogen and
carbon in various proportions. They are of two kinds, <i>fixed</i> and
<i>volatile</i>, both of which we formerly mentioned. Do you remember in
what the difference between fixed and volatile oil consists?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>If I recollect rightly, the former are decomposed by heat, whilst the
latter are merely volatilised by&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well. Fixed oil is contained only in the seeds of plants,
excepting in the olive, in which it is produced in, and expressed from,
the fruit. We have already observed that seeds contain also fecula;
these two substances, united with a little mucilage, form the white
substance contained in the seeds or kernels of plants, and is destined
for the nourishment of the young plant, to which the seed gives birth.
The milk of almonds, which is
<span class = "pagenum">178</span>
<a name = "page178" id = "page178"> </a>
expressed from the seed of that name, is composed of these three
substances.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray, of what nature is the linseed oil which is used in
painting?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is a fixed oil, obtained from the seed of flax. Nut oil, which is
frequently used for the same purpose, is expressed from walnuts.</p>

<p>Olive oil is that which is best adapted to culinary purposes.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And what are the oils used for burning?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Animal oils most commonly; but the preference given to them is owing
to their being less expensive; for vegetable oils burn equally well, and
are more pleasant, as their smell is not offensive.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Since oil is so good a combustible, what is the reason that lamps so
frequently require trimming?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This sometimes proceeds from the construction of the lamp, which may
not be sufficiently favourable to a perfect combustion; but there is
<span class = "pagenum">179</span>
<a name = "page179" id = "page179"> </a>
certainly a defect in the nature of oil itself, which renders it
necessary for the best-constructed lamps to be occasionally trimmed.
This defect arises from a portion of mucilage which it is extremely
difficult to separate from the oil, and which being a bad combustible,
gathers round the wick, and thus impedes its combustion, and
consequently dims the light.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But will not oils burn without a wick?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not unless their temperature be elevated to five or six hundred
degrees; the wick answers this purpose, as I think I once before
explained to you. The oil rises between the fibres of the cotton by
capillary attraction, and the heat of the burning wick volatilises it,
and brings it successively to the temperature at which it is
combustible.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I suppose the explanation which you have given with regard to the
necessity of trimming lamps, applies also to candles, which so often
require snuffing?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I believe it does; at least, in some degree. But besides the
circumstance just explained, the common
<span class = "pagenum">180</span>
<a name = "page180" id = "page180"> </a>
sorts of oils are not very highly combustible, so that the heat produced
by a candle, which is a coarse kind of animal oil, being insufficient to
volatilise them completely, a&nbsp;quantity of soot is gradually
deposited on the wick, which dims the light, and retards the
combustion.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Wax candles then contain no incombustible matter, since they do not
require snuffing?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Wax is a much better combustible than tallow, but still not perfectly
so, since it likewise contains some particles that are unfit for
burning; but when these gather round the wick, (which in a wax light is
comparatively small,) they weigh it down on one side, and fall off
together with the burnt part of the wick.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>As oils are such good combustibles, I wonder that they should require
so great an elevation of temperature before they begin to burn?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Though fixed oils will not enter into actual combustion below the
temperature of about four hundred degrees, yet they will slowly absorb
oxygen
<span class = "pagenum">181</span>
<a name = "page181" id = "page181"> </a>
at the common temperature of the atmosphere. Hence arises a variety of
changes in oils which modify their properties and uses in the arts.</p>

<p>If oil simply absorbs, and combines with oxygen, it thickens and
changes to a kind of wax. This change is observed to take place on the
external parts of certain vegetables, even during their life. But it
happens in many instances that the oil does not retain all the oxygen
which it attracts, but that part of it combines with, or burns, the
hydrogen of the oil, thus forming a quantity of water, which gradually
goes off by evaporation. In this case the alteration of the oil consists
not only in the addition of a certain quantity of oxygen, but in the
diminution of the hydrogen. These oils are distinguished by the name of
<i>drying oils</i>. Linseed, poppy, and nut-oils, are of this
description.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I am well acquainted with drying oils, as I continually use them in
painting. But I do not understand why the acquisition of oxygen on one
hand, and a loss of hydrogen on the other, should render them
drying?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This, I conceive, may arise from two reasons; either from the oxygen
which is added being less
<span class = "pagenum">182</span>
<a name = "page182" id = "page182"> </a>
favourable to the state of fluidity than the hydrogen, which is
subtracted; or from this additional quantity of oxygen giving rise to
new combinations, in consequence of which the most fluid parts of the
oil are liberated and volatilised.</p>

<p>For the purpose of painting, the drying quality of oil is further
increased by adding a quantity of oxyd of lead to it, by which means it
is more rapidly oxygenated.</p>

<p>The rancidity of oil is likewise owing to their oxygenation. In this
case a new order of attraction takes place, from which a peculiar acid
is formed, called the <i>sebacic acid</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Since the nature and composition of oil is so well known, pray could
not oil be actually <i>made</i>, by combining its principles?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is by no means a necessary consequence; for there are
innumerable varieties of compound bodies which we can decompose,
although we are unable to reunite their ingredients. This, however, is
not the case with oil, as it has very lately been discovered, that it is
possible to form oil, by a peculiar process, from the action of
oxygenated muriatic acid gas on hydro-carbonate.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">183</span>
<a name = "page183" id = "page183"> </a>
<p>We now pass to the <i>volatile</i> or <i>essential oils</i>. These
form the basis of all the vegetable perfumes, and are contained, more or
less, in every part of the plant excepting the seed; they are, at least,
never found in that part of the seed which contains the embrio
plant.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The smell of flowers, then, proceeds from volatile oil?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly; but this oil is often most abundant in the rind of fruits,
as in oranges, lemons,&nbsp;&amp;c. from which it may be extracted by
the slightest pressure; it is found also in the leaves of plants, and
even in the wood.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is it not very plentiful in the leaves of mint, and of thyme, and all
the sweet-smelling herbs?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, remarkably so; and in geranium leaves also, which have a much
more powerful odour than the flowers.</p>

<p>The perfume of sandal fans is an instance of its existence in wood.
In short, all vegetable odours or perfumes are produced by the
evaporation of particles of these volatile oils.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">184</span>
<a name = "page184" id = "page184"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>They are, I suppose, very light, and of very thin consistence, since
they are so volatile?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They vary very much in this respect, some of them being as thick as
butter, whilst others are as fluid as water. In order to be prepared for
perfumes, or essences, these oils are first properly purified, and then
either distilled with spirit of wine, as in the case with lavender
water, or simply mixed with a large proportion of water, as is often
done with regard to peppermint. Frequently, also, these odoriferous
waters are prepared merely by soaking the plants in water, and
distilling. The water then comes over impregnated with the volatile
oil.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Such waters are frequently used to take spots of grease out of cloth,
or silk; how do they produce that effect?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By combining with the substance that forms these stains; for volatile
oils, and likewise the spirit in which they are distilled, will dissolve
wax, tallow, spermaceti, and resins; if, therefore, the spot proceeds
from any of these substances, it
<span class = "pagenum">185</span>
<a name = "page185" id = "page185"> </a>
will remove it. Insects of every kind have a great aversion to perfumes,
so that volatile oils are employed with success in museums for the
preservation of stuffed birds and other species of animals.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Pray does not the powerful smell of camphor proceed from a volatile
oil?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p><i>Camphor</i> seems to be a substance of its own kind, remarkable by
many peculiarities. But if not exactly of the same nature as volatile
oil, it is at least very analogous to it. It is obtained chiefly from
the camphor-tree, a&nbsp;species of laurel which grows in China, and in
the Indian isles, from the stem and roots of which it is extracted.
Small quantities have also been distilled from thyme, sage, and other
aromatic plants; and it is deposited in pretty large quantities by some
volatile oils after long standing. It is extremely volatile and
inflammable. It is insoluble in water, but is soluble in oils, in which
state, as well as in its solid form, it is frequently applied to
medicinal purposes. Amongst the particular properties of camphor, there
is one too singular to be passed over in silence. If you take a small
piece of camphor, and place it on the surface of a bason of pure water,
it will immediately begin to move round
<span class = "pagenum">186</span>
<a name = "page186" id = "page186"> </a>
and round with great rapidity; but if you pour into the bason a single
drop of any odoriferous fluid, it will instantly put a stop to this
motion. You can at any time try this very simple experiment; but you
must not expect that I shall be able to account for this phenomenon, as
nothing satisfactory has yet been advanced for its explanation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is very singular indeed; and I will certainly try the experiment.
Pray what are <i>resins</i>, which you just now mentioned?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They are volatile oils, that have been acted on, and peculiarly
modified, by oxygen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>They are, therefore, oxygenated volatile oils?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not exactly; for the process does not appear to consist so much in
the oxygenation of the oil, as in the combustion of a portion of its
hydrogen, and a small portion of its carbon. For when resins are
artificially made by the combination of volatile oils with oxygen, the
vessel in which the process is performed is bedewed with water, and the
air included within is loaded with carbonic acid.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">187</span>
<a name = "page187" id = "page187"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This process must be, in some respects, similar to that for preparing
drying oils?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; and it is by this operation that both of them acquire a greater
degree of consistence. Pitch, tar, and turpentine, are the most common
resins; they exude from the pine and fir trees. Copal, mastic, and
frankincense, are also of this class of vegetable substances.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is it of these resins that the mastic and copal varnishes, so much
used in painting, are made?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes. Dissolved either in oil, or in alcohol, resins form varnishes.
From these solutions they may be precipitated by water, in which they
are insoluble. This I can easily show you.&mdash;If you will pour some
water into this glass of mastic varnish, it will combine with the
alcohol in which the resin is dissolved, and the latter will be
precipitated in the form of a white cloud&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It is so. And yet how is it that pictures or
<span class = "pagenum">188</span>
<a name = "page188" id = "page188"> </a>
drawings, varnished with this solution, may safely be washed with
water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>As the varnish dries, the alcohol evaporates, and the dry varnish or
resin which remains, not being soluble in water, will not be acted on
by&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>There is a class of compound resins called <i>gum-resins</i>, which
are precisely what their name denotes, that is to say, resins combined
with mucilage. Myrrh and assafœtida are of this description.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is it possible that a substance of so disagreeable a smell as
assafœtida can be formed from a volatile oil?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The odour of volatile oils is by no means always grateful. Onions and
garlic derive their smell from volatile oils, as well as roses and
lavender.</p>

<p>There is still another form under which volatile oils present
themselves, which is that of <i>balsams</i>. These consist of resinous
juices combined with a peculiar acid, called the benzoic acid. Balsams
appear to have been originally volatile oils, the oxygenation of which
has converted one part into a resin, and the other part into an acid,
which,
<span class = "pagenum">189</span>
<a name = "page189" id = "page189"> </a>
combined together, form a balsam; such are the balsams of Peru,
Tolu,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>


<p class = "space">
We shall now take leave of the oils and their various modifications, and
proceed to the next vegetable substance, which is <i>caoutchouc</i>.
This is a white milky glutinous fluid, which acquires consistence, and
blackens in drying, in which state it forms the substance with which you
are so well acquainted, under the name of gum-elastic.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I am surprised to hear that gum-elastic was ever white, or ever
fluid! And from what vegetable is it procured?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is obtained from two or three different species of trees, in the
East-Indies, and South-America, by making incisions in the stem. The
juice is collected as it trickles from these incisions, and moulds of
clay, in the form of little bottles of gum-elastic, are dipped into it.
A&nbsp;layer of this juice adheres to the clay and dries on it; and
several layers are successively added by repeating this till the bottle
is of sufficient thickness. It is then beaten to break down the clay,
which is easily shaken out. The natives of the countries where this
substance is produced sometimes make shoes and boots of it by a similar
process, and
<span class = "pagenum">190</span>
<a name = "page190" id = "page190"> </a>
they are said to be extremely pleasant and serviceable, both from their
elasticity, and their being water-proof.</p>


<p class = "space">
The substance which comes next in our enumeration of the immediate
ingredients of vegetables, is <i>extractive matter</i>. This is a term,
which, in a general sense, may be applied to any substance extracted
from vegetables; but it is more particularly understood to relate to the
extractive <i>colouring matter</i> of plants. A&nbsp;great variety of
colours are prepared from the vegetable kingdom, both for the purposes
of painting and of dying; all the colours called <i>lakes</i> are of
this description; but they are less durable than mineral colours, for,
by long exposure to the atmosphere, they either darken or turn
yellow.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I know that in painting, the lakes are reckoned far less durable
colours than the ochres; but what is the reason of&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The change which takes place in vegetable colours is owing chiefly to
the oxygen of the atmosphere slowly burning their hydrogen, and leaving,
in some measure, the blackness of the carbon exposed.
<span class = "pagenum">191</span>
<a name = "page191" id = "page191"> </a>
Such change cannot take place in ochre, which is altogether a mineral
substance.</p>

<p>Vegetable colours have a stronger affinity for animal than for
vegetable substances, and this is supposed to be owing to a small
quantity of nitrogen which they contain. Thus, silk and worsted will
take a much finer vegetable dye than linen and cotton.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Dying, then, is quite a chemical process?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly. The condition required to form a good dye is, that the
colouring matter should be precipitated, or fixed, on the substance to
be dyed, and should form a compound not soluble in the liquids to which
it will probably be exposed. Thus, for instance, printed or dyed linens
or cottons must be able to resist the action of soap and water, to which
they must necessarily be subject in washing; and woollens and silks
should withstand the action of grease and acids, to which they may
accidentally be exposed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But if linen and cotton have not a sufficient affinity for colouring
matter, how are they made to resist the action of washing, which they
always do when they are well printed?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">192</span>
<a name = "page192" id = "page192"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>When the substance to be dyed has either no affinity for the
colouring matter, or not sufficient power to retain it, the combination
is effected, or strengthened, by the intervention of a third substance,
called a <i>mordant</i>, or basis. The mordant must have a strong
affinity both for the colouring matter and the substance to be dyed, by
which means it causes them to combine and adhere together.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And what are the substances that perform the office of thus
reconciling the two adverse parties?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The most common mordant is sulphat of alumine, or alum. Oxyds of tin
and iron, in the state of compound salts, are likewise used for that
purpose.</p>

<p><i>Tannin</i> is another vegetable ingredient of great importance in
the arts. It is obtained chiefly from the bark of trees; but it is found
also in nut-galls, and in some other vegetables.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is that the substance commonly called <i>tan</i>, which is used in
hot-houses?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">193</span>
<a name = "page193" id = "page193"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Tan is the prepared bark in which the peculiar substance, tannin, is
contained. But the use of tan in hot-houses is of much less importance
than in the operation of <i>tanning</i>, by which skin is converted into
leather.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray, how is this operation performed?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Various methods are employed for this purpose, which all consist in
exposing skin to the action of tannin, or of substances containing this
principle, in sufficient quantities, and disposed to yield it to the
skin. The most usual way is to infuse coarsely powdered oak bark in
water, and to keep the skin immersed in this infusion for a certain
length of time. During this process, which is slow and gradual, the skin
is found to have increased in weight, and to have acquired a
considerable tenacity and impermeability to water. This effect may be
much accelerated by using strong saturations of the tanning principle
(which can be extracted from bark), instead of employing the bark
itself. But this quick mode of preparation does not appear to make
equally good leather.</p>

<p>Tannin is contained in a great variety of
<span class = "pagenum">194</span>
<a name = "page194" id = "page194"> </a>
astringent vegetable substances, as galls, the rose-tree, and wine; but
it is nowhere so plentiful as in bark. All these substances yield it to
water, from which it may be precipitated by a solution of isinglass, or
glue, with which it strongly unites and forms an insoluble compound.
Hence its valuable property of combining with skin (which consists
chiefly of glue), and of enabling it to resist the action of water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Might we not see that effect by pouring a little melted isinglass
into a glass of wine, which you say contains tannin?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes. I have prepared a solution of isinglass for that very
purpose.&mdash;Do you observe the thick muddy precipitate?&mdash;That is
the tannin combined with the isinglass.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This precipitate must then be of the same nature as leather?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is composed of the same ingredients; but the organisation and
texture of the skin being wanting, it has neither the consistence nor
the tenacity of leather.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">195</span>
<a name = "page195" id = "page195"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>One might suppose that men who drink large quantities of red wine
stand a chance of having the coats of their stomachs converted into
leather, since tannin has so strong an affinity for skin.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is not impossible but that the coats of their stomachs may be, in
some measure, tanned, or hardened by the constant use of this liquor;
but you must remember that where a number of other chemical agents are
concerned, and, above all, where life exists, no certain chemical
inference can be drawn.</p>

<p>I must not dismiss this subject, without mentioning a recent
discovery of Mr. Hatchett, which relates to it. This gentleman found
that a substance very similar to tannin, possessing all its leading
properties, and actually capable of tanning leather, may be produced by
exposing carbon, or any substance containing carbonaceous matter,
whether vegetable, animal, or mineral, to the action of nitric acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And is not this discovery very likely to be of use to
manufactures?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is very doubtful, because tannin, thus artificially
<span class = "pagenum">196</span>

prepared, must probably always be more expensive than that which is
obtained from bark. But the fact is extremely curious, as it affords one
of those very rare instances of chemistry being able to imitate the
proximate principles of organised bodies.</p>

The last of the vegetable materials is <i>woody fibre</i>; it is the
hardest part of plants. The chief source from which this substance is
derived is wood, but it is also contained, more or less, in every solid
part of that plant. It forms a kind of skeleton of the part to which it
belongs, and retains its shape after all the other materials have
disappeared. It consists chiefly of carbon, united with a small
proportion of salts, and the other constituents common to all
vegetables.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It is of woody fibre, then, that the common charcoal is made?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes. Charcoal, as you may recollect, is obtained from wood, by the

more oxygen be added to it, it loses its vegetable nature, and is
resolved into carbonic acid and water; therefore, though all the other
acids may be converted into the oxalic by an addition of oxygen, the
oxalic itself is not susceptible of a further degree of oxygenation; nor
can it be made, by any chemical processes, to return to a state of lower
acidification.</p>

<p>Is not this the same acid before mentioned, which forms ink, by

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes. Though it is usually extracted from galls, on account of its
being most abundant in that vegetable substance, it may also be obtained
from a great variety of plants. It constitutes what is called the
<i>astringent principle</i> of vegetables; it is generally combined with
tannin, and you will find that an infusion of tea, coffee, bark,
red-wine, or any vegetable substance that contains the astringent
principle, will make a black precipitate with a solution of sulphat of
iron.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They are excrescences which grow on the bark of young oaks, and are
occasioned by an insect which wounds the bark of trees, and lays its
eggs in the aperture. The lacerated vessels of the tree then discharge
their contents, and form an excrescence, which affords a defensive
covering for these eggs. The insect, when come to life, first feeds on
this excrescence, and some time afterward eats its way out, as it
appears from a hole which is formed in all gall-nuts that no longer
contain an insect. It is in hot climates only that strongly astringent
gall-nuts are found; those which are used for the purpose of making ink
are brought from Aleppo.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But are not the oak-apples, which grow on the leaves of the oak in
this country, of a similar nature?</p>

the astringent principle, and therefore less applicable to useful
purposes.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By no means; on the contrary, they are frequently met with in the
state of compound salts; these, however, are in general not fully
saturated with the salifiable bases, so that the acid predominates; and,
in this state, they are called <i>acidulous</i> salts. Of this kind is
the salt called cream of tartar.</p>

<p>Is not the salt of lemon, commonly used to take out ink-spots and

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; that salt consists of the oxalic acid, combined with a little
potash. It is found in that state in sorrel.</p>

Mrs.&nbsp;B., of the materials of vegetables, is, doubtless, very
instructive; but it does not completely satisfy my curiosity.
I&nbsp;wish to know how plants obtain the principles from which their
various materials are formed; by what means these are converted into
vegetable matter, and how they are connected with the life of the
plant?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This implies nothing less than a complete history of the chemistry
and physiology of vegetation, subjects on which we have yet but very
imperfect notions. Still I hope that I shall be able, in some measure,
to satisfy your curiosity. But, in order to render the subject more
intelligible, I&nbsp;must first
<span class = "pagenum">203</span>
<a name = "page203" id = "page203"> </a>
make you acquainted with the various changes which vegetables undergo,
when the vital power no longer enables them to resist the common laws of
chemical attraction.</p>

<p>The composition of vegetables being more complicated than that of
minerals, the former more readily undergo chemical changes than the
latter: for the greater the variety of attractions, the more easily is
the equilibrium destroyed, and a new order of combinations
introduced.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I am surprised that vegetables should be so easily susceptible of
decomposition; for the preservation of the vegetable kingdom is
certainly far more important than that of minerals.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You must consider, on the other hand, how much more easily the former
is renewed than the latter. The decomposition of the vegetable takes
place only after the death of the plant, which, in the common course of
nature, happens when it has yielded fruit and seeds to propagate its
species. If, instead of thus finishing its career, each plant was to
retain its form and vegetable state, it would become an useless burden
to the earth and its inhabitants. When vegetables, therefore, cease to
be productive, they cease to live, and nature
<span class = "pagenum">204</span>
<a name = "page204" id = "page204"> </a>
then begins her process of decomposition, in order to resolve them into
their chemical constituents, hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen; those simple
and primitive ingredients, which she keeps in store for all her
combinations.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But since no system of combination can be destroyed, except by the
establishment of another order of attractions, how can the decomposition
of vegetables reduce them to their simple elements?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is a very long process, during which a variety of new combinations
are successively established and successively destroyed: but, in each of
these changes, the ingredients of vegetable matter tend to unite in a
more simple order of compounds, till they are at length brought to their
elementary state, or, at least, to their most simple order of
combinations. Thus you will find that vegetables are in the end almost
entirely reduced to water and carbonic acid; the hydrogen and carbon
dividing the oxygen between them, so as to form with it these two
substances. But the variety of intermediate combinations that take place
during the several stages of the decomposition of vegetables, present us
with a new set of compounds, well worthy of our examination.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">205</span>
<a name = "page205" id = "page205"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How is it possible that vegetables, while putrefying, should produce
any thing worthy of observation?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They are susceptible of undergoing certain changes before they arrive
at the state of putrefaction, which is the final term of decomposition;
and of these changes we avail ourselves for particular and important
purposes. But, in order to make you understand this subject, which is of
considerable importance, I&nbsp;must explain it more in detail.</p>

<p>The decomposition of vegetables is always attended by a violent
internal motion, produced by the disunion of one order of particles, and
the combination of another. This is called <span class =
"smallroman">FERMENTATION</span>. There are several periods at which
this process stops, so that a state of rest appears to be restored, and
the new order of compounds fairly established. But, unless means be used
to secure these new combinations in their actual state, their duration
will be but transient, and a new fermentation will take place, by which
the compound last formed will be <ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘detroyed’">destroyed</ins>;
and another, and less complex order, will succeed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The fermentations, then, appear to be only the
<span class = "pagenum">206</span>
<a name = "page206" id = "page206"> </a>
successive steps by which a vegetable descends to its final
dissolution.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Precisely so. Your definition is perfectly correct.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And how many fermentations, or new arrangements, does a vegetable
undergo before it is reduced to its simple ingredients?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Chemists do not exactly agree in this point; but there are,
I&nbsp;think, four distinct fermentations, or periods, at which the
decomposition of vegetable matter stops and changes its course. But
every kind of vegetable matter is not equally susceptible of undergoing
all these fermentations.</p>

<p>There are likewise several circumstances required to produce
fermentation. Water and a certain degree of heat are both essential to
this process, in order to separate the particles, and thus weaken their
force of cohesion, that the new chemical affinities may be brought into
action.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>In frozen climates, then, how can the spontaneous decomposition of
vegetables take place?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">207</span>
<a name = "page207" id = "page207"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It certainly cannot; and, accordingly, we find scarcely any vestiges
of vegetation where a constant frost prevails.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>One would imagine that, on the contrary, such spots would be covered
with vegetables; for, since they cannot be decomposed, their number must
always increase.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But, my dear, heat and water are quite as essential to the formation
of vegetables, as they are to their decomposition. Besides, it is from
the dead vegetables, reduced to their elementary principles, that the
rising generation is supplied with sustenance. No young plant,
therefore, can grow unless its predecessors contribute both to its
formation and support; and these not only furnish the seed from which
the new plant springs, but likewise the food by which it is
nourished.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Under the torrid zone, therefore, where water is never frozen, and
the heat is very great, both the processes of vegetation and of
fermentation must, I&nbsp;suppose, be extremely rapid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not so much as you imagine: for in such climates
<span class = "pagenum">208</span>
<a name = "page208" id = "page208"> </a>
<ins class = "mycorr" title = "missing ‘a’?">great</ins> part of the
water which it requires for these processes is in an aëriform state,
which is scarcely more conducive either to the growth or formation of
vegetables than that of ice. In those latitudes, therefore, it is only
in low damp situations, sheltered by woods from the sun’s rays, that the
smaller tribes of vegetables can grow and thrive during the dry season,
as dead vegetables seldom retain water enough to produce fermentation,
but are, on the contrary, soon dried up by the heat of the sun, which
enables them to resist that process; so that it is not till the fall of
the autumnal rains (which are very violent in such climates), that
spontaneous fermentation can take place.</p>

<p>The several fermentations derive their names from their principal
products. The first is called the <i>saccharine fermentation</i>,
because its product is <i>sugar</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But sugar, you have told us, is found in all vegetables; it cannot,
therefore, be the product of their decomposition.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is true that this fermentation is not confined to the
decomposition of vegetables, as it continually takes place during their
life; and, indeed, this circumstance has, till lately, prevented it from
<span class = "pagenum">209</span>
<a name = "page209" id = "page209"> </a>
being considered as one of the fermentations. But the process appears so
analogous to the other fermentations, and the formation of sugar,
whether in living or dead vegetable matter is so evidently a new
compound, proceeding from the destruction of the previous order of
combinations, and essential to the subsequent fermentations, that it is
now, I&nbsp;believe, generally esteemed the first step, or necessary
preliminary, to decomposition, if not an actual commencement of that
process.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I recollect your hinting to us that sugar was supposed not to be
secreted from the sap, in the same manner as mucilage, fecula, oil, and
the other ingredients of vegetables.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is rather from these materials, than from the sap itself, that
sugar is formed; and it is developed at particular periods, as you may
observe in fruits, which become sweet in ripening, sometimes even after
they have been gathered. Life, therefore, is not essential to the
formation of sugar, whilst on the contrary, mucilage, fecula, and the
other vegetable materials that are secreted from the sap by appropriate
organs, whose powers immediately depend on the vital principle, cannot
be
<span class = "pagenum">210</span>
<a name = "page210" id = "page210"> </a>
produced but during the existence of that principle.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The ripening of fruits is, then, their first step to destruction, as
well as their last towards perfection?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Exactly.&mdash;A process analogous to the saccharine fermentation
takes place also during the cooking of certain vegetables. This is the
case with parsnips, carrots, potatoes, &amp;c. in which sweetness is
developed by heat and moisture; and we know that if we carried the
process a little farther, a&nbsp;more complete decomposition would
ensue. The same process takes place also in seeds previous to their
sprouting.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How do you reconcile this to your theory, Mrs.&nbsp;B.? Can you
suppose that a decomposition is the necessary precursor of life?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is indeed the case. The materials of the seed must be
decomposed, and the seed disorganized, before a plant can sprout from
it. Seeds, besides the embrio plant, contain (as we have already
observed) fecula, oil, and a little mucilage. These substances are
destined for the nourishment of the future plant; but they undergo some
change
<span class = "pagenum">211</span>
<a name = "page211" id = "page211"> </a>
before they can be fit for this function. The seeds, when buried in the
earth, with a certain degree of moisture and of temperature, absorb
water, which dilates them, separates their particles, and introduces a
new order of attractions, of which sugar is the product. The substance
of the seed is thus softened, sweetened, and converted into a sort of
white milky pulp, fit for the nourishment of the embrio plant.</p>

<p>The saccharine fermentation of seeds is artificially produced, for
the purpose of making <i>malt</i>, by the following
process:&mdash;A&nbsp;quantity of barley is first soaked in water for
two or three days: the water being afterwards drained off, the grain
heats spontaneously, swells, bursts, sweetens, shows a disposition to
germinate, and actually sprouts to the length of an inch, when the
process is stopped by putting it into a kiln, where it is well dried at
a gentle heat. In this state it is crisp and friable, and constitutes
the substance called <i>malt</i>, which is the principal ingredient of
beer.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But I hope you will tell us how malt is made into beer?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly; but I must first explain to you the nature of the second
fermentation, which is essential
<span class = "pagenum">212</span>
<a name = "page212" id = "page212"> </a>
to that operation. This is called the <i>vinous fermentation</i>,
because its product is <i>wine</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>How very different the decomposition of vegetables is from what I had
imagined! The products of their disorganisation appear almost superior
to those which they yield during their state of life and perfection.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And do you not, at the same time, admire the beautiful economy of
Nature, which, whether she creates, or whether she destroys, directs all
her operations to some useful and benevolent purpose?&mdash;It appears
that the saccharine fermentation is extremely favourable, if not
absolutely essential, as a previous step, to the vinous fermentation; so
that if sugar be not developed during the life of the plant, the
saccharine fermentation must be artificially produced before the vinous
fermentation can take place. This is the case with barley, which does
not yield any sugar until it is made into malt; and it is in that state
only that it is susceptible of undergoing the vinous fermentation by
which it is converted into beer.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But if the product of the vinous fermentation
<span class = "pagenum">213</span>
<a name = "page213" id = "page213"> </a>
is always wine, beer cannot have undergone that process, for beer is
certainly not wine.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Chemically speaking, beer may be considered as the wine of grain. For
it is the product of the fermentation of malt, just as wine is that of
the fermentation of grapes, or other fruits.</p>

<p>The consequence of the vinous fermentation is the decomposition of
the saccharine matter, and the formation of a spirituous liquor from the
constituents of the sugar. But, in order to promote this fermentation,
not only water and a certain degree of heat are necessary, but also some
other vegetable ingredients, besides the sugar, as fecula, mucilage,
acids, salts, extractive matter, &amp;c. all of which seem to contribute
to this process; and give to the liquor its peculiar taste.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, for this reason that wine is not obtained from the
fermentation of pure sugar; but that fruits are chosen for that purpose,
as they contain not only sugar, but likewise the other vegetable
ingredients which promote the vinous fermentation, and give the peculiar
flavour.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly. And you must observe also, that
<span class = "pagenum">214</span>
<a name = "page214" id = "page214"> </a>
the relative quantity of sugar is not the only circumstance to be
considered in the choice of vegetable juices for the formation of wine;
otherwise the sugar-cane would be best adapted for that purpose. It is
rather the manner and proportion in which the sugar is mixed with other
vegetable ingredients that influences the production and qualities of
wine. And it is found that the juice of the grape not only yields the
most considerable proportion of wine, but that it likewise affords it of
the most grateful flavour.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I have seen a vintage in Switzerland, and I do not recollect that
heat was applied, or water added, to produce the fermentation of the
grapes.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The common temperature of the atmosphere in the cellars in which the
juice of the grape is fermented is sufficiently warm for this purpose;
and as the juice contains an ample supply of water, there is no occasion
for any addition of it. But when fermentation is produced in dry malt,
a&nbsp;quantity of water must necessarily be added.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But what are precisely the changes that happen during the vinous
fermentation?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">215</span>
<a name = "page215" id = "page215"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The sugar is decomposed, and its constituents are recombined into two
new substances; the one a peculiar liquid substance, called
<i>alcohol</i> or <i>spirit of wine</i>, which remains in the fluid; the
other, carbonic acid gas, which escapes during the fermentation. Wine,
therefore, as I before observed, in a general point of view, may be
considered as a liquid of which alcohol constitutes the essential part.
And the varieties of strength and flavour of the different kinds of wine
are to be attributed to the different qualities of the fruits from which
they are obtained, independently of the sugar.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I am astonished to hear that so powerful a liquid as spirit of wine
should be obtained from so mild a substance as sugar.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Can you tell me in what the principal difference consists between
alcohol and sugar?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Let me reflect . . . . . Sugar consists of carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen. If carbonic acid be subtracted from it, during the formation of
alcohol, the latter will contain less carbon and oxygen
<span class = "pagenum">216</span>
<a name = "page216" id = "page216"> </a>
than sugar does; therefore hydrogen must be the prevailing principle of
alcohol.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is exactly so. And this very large proportion of hydrogen accounts
for the lightness and combustible property of alcohol, and of spirits in
general, all of which consist of alcohol variously modified.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And can sugar be recomposed from the combination of alcohol and
carbonic acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Chemists have never been able to succeed in effecting this; but from
analogy, I&nbsp;should suppose such a recomposition possible. Let us now
observe more particularly the phenomena that take place during the
vinous fermentation. At the commencement of this process, heat is
evolved, and the liquor swells considerably from the formation of the
carbonic acid, which is disengaged in such prodigious quantities as
would be fatal to any person who should unawares inspire it; an accident
which has sometimes happened. If the fermentation be stopped by putting
the liquor into barrels, before the whole of the carbonic acid is
evolved, the wine is brisk, like Champagne,
<span class = "pagenum">217</span>
<a name = "page217" id = "page217"> </a>
from the carbonic acid imprisoned in it, and it tastes sweet, like
cyder, from the sugar not being completely decomposed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But I do not understand why heat should be evolved during this
operation. For, as there is a considerable formation of gas, in which a
proportionable quantity of heat must become insensible, I&nbsp;should
have imagined that cold, rather than heat, would have been produced.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It appears so on first consideration; but you must recollect that
fermentation is a complicated chemical process; and that, during the
decompositions and recompositions attending it, a&nbsp;quantity of
chemical heat may be disengaged, sufficient both to develope the gas,
and to effect an increase of temperature. When the fermentation is
completed, the liquid cools and subsides, the effervescence ceases, and
the thick, sweet, sticky juice of the fruit is converted into a clear,
transparent, spirituous liquor, called wine.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>How much I regret not having been acquainted with the nature of the
vinous fermentation, when I had an opportunity of seeing the
process!</p>

<p>You have an easy method of satisfying yourself in that respect by
observing the process of brewing, which, in every essential
circumstance, is similar to that of making wine, and is really a very
curious chemical operation.</p>

<p>Although we cannot actually make wine at this moment, it will be easy
to show you the mode of analyzing it. This is done by distillation. When
wine of any kind is submitted to this operation, it is found to contain
brandy, water, tartar, extractive colouring matter, and some vegetable
acids. I&nbsp;have put a little port wine into this alembic of glass (<a

<p>But you do not mention alcohol amongst the <i>products</i> of the
distillation of wine; and yet that is its most essential ingredient?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The alcohol is contained in the brandy which is now coming over, and
dropping from the still. Brandy is nothing more than a mixture of
alcohol and water; and in order to obtain the alcohol pure, we must
again distil it from brandy.</p>

<p>I have just taken a drop on my finger; it tastes like strong brandy,
but it is without colour, whilst brandy is of a deep yellow.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is not so naturally; in its pure state brandy is colourless, and
it obtains the yellow tint you observe, by extracting the colouring
matter from the new oaken casks in which it is kept. But if it does not
acquire the usual tinge in this way, it is the custom to colour the
brandy used in this country artificially, with a little burnt sugar, in
order to give it the appearance of having been long kept.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And is rum also distilled from wine?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By no means; it is distilled from the sugar-cane, a&nbsp;plant which
contains so great a quantity of sugar, that it yields more alcohol than
almost any other vegetable. After the juice of the cane has been pressed
out for making sugar, what still remains in the bruised cane is
extracted by water, and this watery solution of sugar is fermented, and
produces rum.</p>

<p>The spirituous liquor called <i>arack</i> is in a similar manner

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But rice has no sweetness; does it contain any sugar?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Like barley and most other seeds, it is insipid until it has
undergone the saccharine fermentation; and this, you must recollect, is
always a previous step to the vinous fermentation in those vegetables in
which sugar is not already formed. Brandy may in the same manner be
obtained from malt.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>You mean from beer, I suppose; for the malt must have previously
undergone the vinous fermentation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Beer is not precisely the product of the vinous fermentation of malt.
For hops are a necessary ingredient for the formation of that liquor;
whilst brandy is distilled from pure fermented malt. But brandy might,
no doubt, be distilled from beer as well as from any other liquor that
has undergone the vinous fermentation; for since the basis of brandy is
alcohol, it may be obtained from any liquid that contains that
spirituous substance.</p>

<p>And pray, from what vegetable is the favourite spirit of the lower
orders of people, gin, extracted?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The spirit (which is the same in all fermented liquors) may be
obtained from any kind of grain; but the peculiar flavour which
distinguishes gin is that of juniper berries, which are distilled
together with the grain&mdash;</p>

<p>I think the brandy contained in the wine which we are distilling

now dropping from the alembic&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is perfectly insipid, like water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is water, which, as I was telling you, is the second product of
wine, and comes over after all the spirit, which is the lightest part,
is distilled.&mdash;The tartar and extractive colouring matter we shall
find in a solid form at the bottom of the alembic.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>They look very like the lees of wine.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And in many respects they are of a similar nature;
<span class = "pagenum">222</span>
<a name = "page222" id = "page222"> </a>
for lees of wine consist chiefly of tartrit of potash; a&nbsp;salt which
exists in the juice of the grape, and in many other vegetables, and is
developed only by the vinous fermentation. During this operation it is
precipitated, and deposits itself on the internal surface of the cask in
which the wine is contained. It is much used in medicine, and in various
arts, particularly dying, under the name of <i>cream of tartar</i>, and
it is from this salt that the tartarous acid is obtained.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But the medicinal cream of tartar is in appearance quite different
from these dark-coloured dregs; it is perfectly colourless.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because it consists of the pure salts only, in its crystallised form;
whilst in the instance before us it is mixed with the deep-coloured
extractive matter, and other foreign ingredients.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray cannot we now obtain pure alcohol from the brandy which we have
distilled?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We might; but the process would be tedious: for in order to obtain
alcohol perfectly free from
<span class = "pagenum">223</span>
<a name = "page223" id = "page223"> </a>
water, it is necessary to distil, or, as the distillers call it,
<i>rectify</i> it several times. You must therefore allow me to produce
a bottle of alcohol that has been thus purified. This is a very
important ingredient, which has many striking properties, besides its
forming the basis of all spirituous liquors.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It is alcohol, I suppose, that produces intoxication?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly; but the stimulus and momentary energy it gives to the
system, and the intoxication it occasions when taken in excess, are
circumstances not yet accounted for.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I thought that it produced these effects by increasing the rapidity
of the circulation of the blood; for drinking wine or spirits,
I&nbsp;have heard, always quickens the pulse.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No doubt; the spirit, by stimulating the nerves, increases the action
of the muscles; and the heart, which is one of the strongest muscular
organs, beats with augmented vigour, and propels the blood with
accelerated quickness. After such a
<span class = "pagenum">224</span>
<a name = "page224" id = "page224"> </a>
strong excitation the frame naturally suffers a proportional degree of
depression, so that a state of debility and <ins class = "mycorr" title
= "text reads ‘langour’">languor</ins> is the invariable consequence of
intoxication. But though these circumstances are well ascertained, they
are far from explaining why alcohol should produce such effects.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Liqueurs are the only kind of spirits which I think pleasant. Pray of
what do they consist?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They are composed of alcohol, sweetened with syrup, and flavoured
with volatile oil.</p>

<p>The different kinds of odoriferous spirituous waters are likewise
solutions of volatile oil in alcohol, as lavender water, eau de
Cologne,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p>The chemical properties of alcohol are important and numerous. It is
one of the most powerful chemical agents, and is particularly useful in
dissolving a variety of substances, which are soluble neither by water
nor heat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>We have seen it dissolve copal and mastic to form varnishes; and
these resins are certainly not soluble in water, since water
precipitates them from their solution in alcohol.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">225</span>
<a name = "page225" id = "page225"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I am happy to find that you recollect these circumstances so well.
The same experiment affords also an instance of another property of
alcohol,&mdash;its tendency to unite with water; for the resin is
precipitated in consequence of losing the alcohol, which abandons it
from its preference for water. It is attended also, as you may
recollect, with the same peculiar circumstance of a disengagement of
heat and consequent diminution of bulk, which we have supposed to be
produced by a mechanical penetration of particles by which latent heat
is forced out.</p>

<p>Alcohol unites thus readily not only with resins and with water, but
with oils and balsams; these compounds form the extensive class of
elixirs, tinctures, quintessences,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I suppose that alcohol must be highly combustible, since it contains
so large a proportion of hydrogen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Extremely so; and it will burn at a very moderate temperature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I have often seen both brandy and spirit of
<span class = "pagenum">226</span>
<a name = "page226" id = "page226"> </a>
wine burnt; they produce a great deal of flame, but not a proportional
quantity of heat, and no smoke whatever.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The last circumstance arises from their combustion being complete;
and the disproportion between the flame and heat shows you that these
are by no means synonymous.</p>

<p>The great quantity of flame proceeds from the combustion of the
hydrogen to which, you know, that manner of burning is
peculiar.&mdash;Have you not remarked also that brandy and alcohol will
burn without a wick?&mdash;They take fire at so low a temperature, that
this assistance is not required to concentrate the heat and volatilise
the fluid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I have sometimes seen brandy burnt by merely heating it in a
spoon.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The rapidity of the combustion of alcohol may, however, be
prodigiously increased by first volatilising it. An ingenious instrument
has been constructed on this principle to answer the purpose of a
blow-pipe, which may be used for melting glass, or other chemical
purposes. It consists of a small metallic vessel (<a class = "smallcaps"
href = "#plateXIV">Plate <ins class = "mycorr"
title = "text reads ‘XIII’">XIV</ins>.</a> Fig.&nbsp;2.), of a
<span class = "pagenum">227</span>
<a name = "page227" id = "page227"> </a>
spherical shape, which contains the alcohol, and is heated by the lamp
beneath it; as soon as the alcohol is volatilised, it passes through the
spout of the vessel, and issues just above the wick of the lamp, which
immediately sets fire to the stream of vapour, as I shall show
you&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>With what amazing violence it burns! The flame of alcohol, in the
state of vapour, is, I&nbsp;fancy, much hotter than when the spirit is
merely burnt in a spoon?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; because in this way the combustion goes on much quicker, and, of
course, the heat is proportionally increased.&mdash;Observe its effect
on this small glass tube, the middle of which I present to the extremity
of the flame, where the heat is greatest.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The glass, in that spot, is become red hot, and bends from its own
weight.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I have now drawn it asunder, and am going to blow a ball at one of
the heated ends; but I must previously close it up, and flatten it with
this little metallic instrument, otherwise the breath would
<span class = "pagenum">228</span>
<a name = "page228" id = "page228"> </a>
pass through the tube without dilating any part of it.&mdash;Now,
Caroline, will you blow strongly into the tube whilst the closed end is
red hot.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>You blowed too hard; for the ball suddenly dilated to a great size,
and then burst in pieces.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You will be more expert another time; but I must caution you, should
you ever use this blow-pipe, to be very careful that the combustion of
the alcohol does not go on with too great violence, for I have seen the
flame sometimes dart out with such force as to reach the opposite wall
of the room, and set the paint on fire. There is, however, no danger of
the vessel bursting, as it is provided with a safety tube, which affords
an additional vent for the vapour of alcohol when required.</p>

<p>The products of the combustion of alcohol consist in a great
proportion of water, and a small quantity of carbonic acid. There is no
smoke or fixed remains whatever.&mdash;How do you account for that,
Emily?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I suppose that the oxygen which the alcohol absorbs in burning,
converts its hydrogen into water
<span class = "pagenum">229</span>
<a name = "page229" id = "page229"> </a>
and its carbon into carbonic acid gas, and thus it is completely
consumed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well.&mdash;<i>Ether</i>, the lightest of all fluids, and with
which you are well acquainted, is obtained from alcohol, of which it
forms the lightest and most volatile part.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Ether, then, is to alcohol, what alcohol is to brandy?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No: there is an essential difference. In order to obtain alcohol from
brandy, you need only deprive the latter of its water; but for the
formation of ether, the alcohol must be decomposed, and one of its
constituents partly subtracted. I&nbsp;leave you to guess which of them
it&nbsp;is&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It cannot be hydrogen, as ether is more volatile than alcohol, and
hydrogen is the lightest of all its ingredients: nor do I suppose that
it can be oxygen, as alcohol contains so small a proportion of that
principle; it is, therefore, most probably, carbon, a&nbsp;diminution of
which would not fail to render the new compound more volatile.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">230</span>
<a name = "page230" id = "page230"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You are perfectly right. The formation of ether consists simply in
subtracting from the alcohol a certain proportion of carbon; this is
effected by the action of the sulphuric, nitric, or muriatic acids, on
alcohol. The acid and carbon remain at the bottom of the vessel, whilst
the decarbonised alcohol flies off in the form of a condensable vapour,
which is ether.</p>

<p>Ether is the most inflammable of all fluids, and burns at so <ins
class = "mycorr" title = "error for ‘low’?">slow</ins> a temperature
that the heat evolved during its combustion is more than is required for
its support, so that a quantity of ether is volatilised, which takes
fire, and gradually increases the violence of the combustion.</p>


<p class = "space">
Sir Humphry Davy has lately discovered a very singular fact respecting
the vapour of ether. If a few drops of ether be poured into a
wine-glass, and a fine platina wire, heated almost to redness, be held
suspended in the glass, close to the surface of the ether, the wire soon
becomes intensely red-hot, and remains so for any length of time. We may
easily try the experiment.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How very curious! The wire is almost white hot, and a pungent smell
rises from the glass. Pray how is this accounted for?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">231</span>
<a name = "page231" id = "page231"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This is owing to a very peculiar property of the vapour of ether, and
indeed of many other combustible gaseous bodies. At a certain
temperature lower than that of ignition, these vapours undergo a slow
and imperfect combustion, which does not give rise, in any sensible
degree, to the phenomena of light and flame, and yet extricates a
quantity of caloric sufficient to react upon the wire and make it
red-hot, and the wire in its turn keeps up the effect as long as the
emission of vapour continues.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But why should not an iron or silver wire produce the same
effect?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because either iron or silver, being much better conductors of heat
than platina, the heat is carried off too fast by those metals to allow
the accumulation of caloric necessary to produce the effect in
question.</p>


<p class = "space">
Ether is so light that it evaporates at the common temperature of the
atmosphere; it is therefore necessary to keep it confined by a well
ground glass stopper. No degree of cold known has ever
frozen&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is it not often taken medicinally?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">232</span>
<a name = "page232" id = "page232"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; it is one of the most effectual antispasmodic medicines, and the
quickness of its effects, as such, probably depends on its being
instantly converted into vapour by the heat of the stomach, through the
intervention of which it acts on the nervous system. But the frequent
use of ether, like that of spirituous liquors, becomes prejudicial, and,
if taken to excess, it produces effects similar to those of
intoxication.</p>

<p>We may now take our leave of the vinous fermentation, of which,
I&nbsp;hope, you have acquired a clear idea; as well as of the several
products that are derived from&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Though this process appears, at first sight, so much complicated, it
may, I&nbsp;think, be summed up in a few words, as it consists in the
conversion of sugar and fermentable bodies into alcohol and carbonic
acid, which give rise both to the formation of wine, and of all kinds of
spirituous liquors.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to the <i>acetous fermentation</i>, which is
thus called, because it converts wine into vinegar, by the formation of
the acetous acid, which is the basis or radical of vinegar.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">233</span>
<a name = "page233" id = "page233"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But is not the acidifying principle of the acetous acid the same as
that of all other acids, oxygen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly; and on that account the contact of air is essential to
this fermentation, as it affords the necessary supply of oxygen.
Vinegar, in order to obtain pure acetous acid from it, must be distilled
and rectified by certain processes.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But pray, Mrs. B., is not the acetous acid frequently formed without
this fermentation taking place? Is it not, for instance, contained in
acid fruits, and in every substance that becomes sour?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No, not in fruits; you confound it with the citric, the malic, the
oxalic, and other vegetable acids, to which living vegetables owe their
acidity. But whenever a vegetable substance turns sour, after it has
ceased to live, the acetous acid is developed by means of the acetous
fermentation, in which the substance advances a step towards its final
decomposition.</p>

<p>Amongst the various instances of acetous fermentation, that of bread
is usually classed.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">234</span>
<a name = "page234" id = "page234"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But the fermentation of bread is produced by yeast; how does that
effect&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is found by experience that any substance that has already
undergone a fermentation, will readily excite it in one that is
susceptible of that process. If, for instance, you mix a little vinegar
with wine, that is intended to be acidified, it will absorb oxygen more
rapidly, and the process be completed much sooner, than if left to
ferment spontaneously. Thus yeast, which is a product of the
fermentation of beer, is used to excite and accelerate the fermentation
of malt, which is to be converted into beer, as well as that of paste
which is to be made into bread.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But if bread undergoes the acetous fermentation, why is it not
sour?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It acquires a certain savour which corrects the heavy insipidity of
flour, and may be reckoned a first degree of acidification; or if the
process were carried further, the bread would become decidedly acid.</p>

<p>There are, however, some chemists who do not
<span class = "pagenum">235</span>
<a name = "page235" id = "page235"> </a>
consider the fermentation of bread as being of the acetous kind, but
suppose that it is a process of fermentation peculiar to that
substance.</p>

<p>The <i>putrid fermentation</i> is the final operation of Nature, and
her last step towards reducing organised bodies to their simplest
combinations. All vegetables spontaneously undergo this fermentation
after death, provided there be a sufficient degree of heat and moisture,
together with access of air; for it is well known that dead plants may
be preserved by drying, or by the total exclusion of air.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But do dead plants undergo the other fermentation previous to this
last; or do they immediately suffer the putrid fermentation?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That depends on a variety of circumstances, such as the degrees of
temperature and of moisture, the nature of the plant itself, &amp;c. But
if you were carefully to follow and examine the decomposition of plants
from their death to their final dissolution, you would generally find a
sweetness developed in the seeds, and a spirituous flavour in the fruits
(which have undergone the saccharine fermentation), previous to the
total disorganisation and separation of the parts.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">236</span>
<a name = "page236" id = "page236"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I have sometimes remarked a kind of spirituous taste in fruits that
were over ripe, especially oranges; and this was just before they became
rotten.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It was then the vinous fermentation which had succeeded the
saccharine, and had you followed up these changes attentively, you would
probably have found the spirituous taste followed by acidity, previous
to the fruit passing to the state of putrefaction.</p>

<p>When the leaves fall from the trees in autumn, they do not (if there
is no great moisture in the atmosphere) immediately undergo a
decomposition, but are first dried and withered; as soon, however, as
the rain sets in, fermentation commences, their gaseous products are
imperceptibly evolved into the atmosphere, and their fixed remains mixed
with their kindred earth.</p>

<p>Wood, when exposed to moisture, also undergoes the putrid
fermentation and becomes rotten.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But I have heard that the <i>dry rot</i>, which is so liable to
destroy the beams of houses, is prevented by a current of air; and yet
you said that air was essential to the putrid fermentation?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">237</span>
<a name = "page237" id = "page237"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>True; but it must not be in such a proportion to the moisture as to
dissolve the latter, and this is generally the case when the rotting of
wood is prevented or stopped by the free access of air. What is commonly
called dry rot, however, is not I believe a true process of
putrefaction. It is supposed to depend on a peculiar kind of vegetation,
which, by feeding on the wood, gradually destroys&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Straw and all other kinds of vegetable matter undergo the putrid
fermentation more rapidly when mixed with animal matter. Much heat is
evolved during this process, and a variety of volatile products are
disengaged, as carbonic acid and hydrogen gas, the latter of which is
frequently either sulphurated or phosphorated.&mdash;When all these
gases have been evolved, the fixed products, consisting of carbon,
salts, potash, &amp;c. form a kind of vegetable earth, which makes very
fine manure, as it is composed of those elements which form the
immediate materials of plants.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Pray are not vegetables sometimes preserved from decomposition by
petrification? I&nbsp;have seen very curious specimens of petrified
vegetables, in which state they perfectly preserve their form
<span class = "pagenum">238</span>
<a name = "page238" id = "page238"> </a>
and organisation, though in appearance they are changed to stone.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is a kind of metamorphosis, which, now that you are tolerably
well versed in the history of mineral and vegetable substances,
I&nbsp;leave to your judgment to explain. Do you imagine that vegetables
can be converted into stone?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>No, certainly; but they might perhaps be changed to a substance in
appearance resembling stone.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is not so, however, with the substances that are called petrified
vegetables; for these are really stone, and generally of the hardest
kind, consisting chiefly of silex. The case is this: when a vegetable is
buried under water, or in wet earth, it is slowly and gradually
decomposed. As each successive particle of the vegetable is destroyed,
its place is supplied by a particle of siliceous earth, conveyed thither
by the water. In the course of time the vegetable is entirely destroyed,
but the silex has completely replaced it, having assumed its form and
apparent texture, as if the vegetable itself were changed to stone.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">239</span>
<a name = "page239" id = "page239"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That is very curious! and I suppose that petrified animal substances
are of the same nature?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Precisely. It is equally impossible for either animal or vegetable
substances to be converted into stone. They may be reduced, as we find
they are, by decomposition, to their constituent elements, but cannot be
changed to elements, which do not enter into their composition.</p>

<p>There are, however, circumstances which frequently prevent the
regular and final decomposition of vegetables; as, for instance, when
they are buried either in the sea, or in the earth, where they cannot
undergo the putrid fermentation for want of air. In these cases they are
subject to a peculiar change, by which they are converted into a new
class of compounds, called <i>bitumens</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>These are substances I never heard of before.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You will find, however, that some of them are very familiar to you.
Bitumens are vegetables so far decomposed as to retain no organic
appearance; but their origin is easily detected by their oily nature,
their combustibility, the products of
<span class = "pagenum">240</span>
<a name = "page240" id = "page240"> </a>
their analysis, and the impressions of the forms of leaves, grains,
fibres of wood, and even of animals, which they frequently bear.</p>

<p>They are sometimes of an oily liquid consistence, as the substance
called <i>naptha</i>, in which we preserved potassium; it is a fine
transparent colourless fluid, that issues out of clays in some parts of
Persia. But more frequently bitumens are solid, as <i>asphaltum</i>,
a&nbsp;smooth, hard, brittle substance, which easily melts, and forms,
in its liquid state, a&nbsp;beautiful dark brown colour for oil
painting. <i>Jet</i>, which is of a still harder texture, is a peculiar
bitumen, susceptible of so fine a polish, that it is used for many
ornamental purposes.</p>


<p class = "space">
<i>Coal</i> is also a bituminous substance, to the composition of which
both the mineral and animal kingdoms seem to concur. This most useful
mineral appears to consist chiefly of vegetable matter, mixed with the
remains of marine animals and marine salts, and occasionally containing
a quantity of sulphuret of iron, commonly called pyrites.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It is, I suppose, the earthly, the metallic, and the saline parts of
coals, that compose the cinders or fixed products of their combustion;
whilst the
<span class = "pagenum">241</span>
<a name = "page241" id = "page241"> </a>
hydrogen and carbon, which they derive from vegetables, constitute their
volatile products.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Pray is not <i>coke</i>, (which I have heard is much used in some
manufactures,) also a bituminous substance?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; it is a kind of fuel artificially prepared from coals. It
consists of coals reduced to a substance analogous to charcoal, by the
evaporation of their bituminous parts. Coke, therefore, is composed of
carbon, with some earthy and saline ingredients.</p>

<p><i>Succin</i>, or <i>yellow amber</i>, is a bitumen which the
ancients called <i>electrum</i>, from whence the word electricity is
derived, as that substance is peculiarly, and was once supposed to be
exclusively, electric. It is found either deeply buried in the bowels of
the earth, or floating on the sea, and is supposed to be a resinous body
which has been acted on by sulphuric acid, as its analysis shows it to
consist of ah oil and an acid. The oil is called <i>oil of amber</i>,
the acid the <i>succinic</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That oil I have sometimes used in painting, as it is reckoned to
change less than the other kinds of oils.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">242</span>
<a name = "page242" id = "page242"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The last class of vegetable substances that have changed their nature
are <i>fossil-wood</i>, <i>peat</i>, and <i>turf</i>. These are composed
of wood and roots of shrubs, that are partly decomposed by being exposed
to moisture under ground, and yet, in some measure, preserve their form
and organic appearance. The peat, or black earth of the moors, retains
but few vestiges of the roots to which it owes its richness and
combustibility, these substances being in the course of time reduced to
the state of vegetable earth. But in turf the roots of plants are still
discernible, and it equally answers the purpose of fuel. It is the
combustible used by the poor in <ins class = "correction" title =
"not an error (heath-y)">heathy</ins> countries, which supply it
abundantly.</p>

<p>It is too late this morning to enter upon the history of vegetation.
We shall reserve this subject, therefore, for our next interview, when I
expect that it will furnish us with ample matter for another
conversation.</p>

KINGDOM</span> may be considered as the link which unites the mineral
and animal creation into one common chain of beings; for it is through
the means of vegetation alone that mineral substances are introduced
into the animal system, since, generally speaking, it is from vegetables
that all animals ultimately derive their sustenance.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I do not understand that; the human species subsists as much on
animal as on vegetable food, and there are some carnivorous animals that
will eat only animal food.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is true; but you do not consider that those that live on animal
food, derive their sustenance equally, though not so immediately, from
<span class = "pagenum">244</span>
<a name = "page244" id = "page244"> </a>
vegetables. The meat that we eat is formed from the herbs of the field,
and the prey of carnivorous animals proceeds, either directly or
indirectly, from the same source. It is, therefore, through this channel
that the simple elements become a part of the animal frame. We should in
vain attempt to derive nourishment from carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,
either in their separate state, or combined in the mineral kingdom; for
it is only by being united in the form of vegetable combination, that
they become capable of conveying nourishment.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Vegetation, then, seems to be the method which Nature employs to
prepare the food of animals?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is certainly its principal object. The vegetable creation does
not exhibit more wisdom in that admirable system of organisation, by
which it is enabled to answer its own immediate ends of preservation,
nutrition, and propagation, than in its grand and ultimate object of
forming those arrangements and combinations of principles, which are so
well adapted for the nourishment of animals.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But I am very curious to know whence vegetables
<span class = "pagenum">245</span>
<a name = "page245" id = "page245"> </a>
obtain those principles which form their immediate materials?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This is a point on which we are yet so much in the dark, that I
cannot hope fully to satisfy your curiosity; but what little I know on
this subject, I&nbsp;will endeavour to explain to you.</p>

<p>The soil, which, at first view, appears to be the aliment of
vegetables, is found, on a closer investigation, to be little more than
the channel through which they receive their nourishment; so that it is
very possible to rear plants without any earth or soil.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Of that we have an instance in the hyacinth and other bulbous roots,
which will grow and blossom beautifully in glasses of water. But I
confess I should think it would be difficult to rear trees in a similar
manner.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No doubt it would, as it is the burying of the roots in the earth
that supports the stem of the tree. But this office, besides that of
affording a vehicle for food, is far the most important part which the
earthy portion of the soil performs in the process of vegetation; for we
can discover, by
<span class = "pagenum">246</span>
<a name = "page246" id = "page246"> </a>
analysis, but an extremely small proportion of earth in vegetable
compounds.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But if earths do not afford nourishment, why is it necessary to be so
attentive to the preparation of the soil?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>In order to impart to it those qualities which render it a proper
vehicle for the food of the plant. Water is the chief nourishment of
vegetables; if, therefore, the soil be too sandy, it will not retain a
quantity of water sufficient to supply the roots of the plants. If, on
the contrary, it abound too much with clay, the water will lodge in such
quantities as to threaten a decomposition of the roots. Calcareous soils
are, upon the whole, the most favourable to the growth of plants: soils
are, therefore, usually improved by chalk, which, you may recollect, is
a carbonat of lime. Different vegetables, however, require different
kinds of soils. Thus rice demands a moist retentive soil; potatoes a
soft sandy soil; wheat a firm and rich soil. Forest trees grow better in
fine sand than in a stiff clay; and a light ferruginous soil is best
suited to fruit-trees.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But pray what is the use of manuring the soil?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">247</span>
<a name = "page247" id = "page247"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Manure consists of all kinds of substances, whether of vegetable or
animal origin, which have undergone the putrid fermentation, and are
consequently decomposed, or nearly so, into their elementary principles.
And it is requisite that these vegetable matters should be in a state of
decay, or approaching decomposition. The addition of calcareous earth,
in the state of chalk or lime, is beneficial to such soils, as it
accelerates the dissolution of vegetable bodies. Now, I&nbsp;ask you,
what is the utility of supplying the soil with these decomposed
substances?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is, I suppose, in order to furnish vegetables with the principles
which enter into their composition. For manures not only contain carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen, but by their decomposition supply the soil with
these principles in their elementary form.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly; and it is for this reason that the finest crops are
produced in fields that were formerly covered with woods, because their
soil is composed of a rich mould, a&nbsp;kind of vegetable earth, which
abounds in those principles.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This accounts for the plentifulness of the crops
<span class = "pagenum">248</span>
<a name = "page248" id = "page248"> </a>
produced in America, where the country was but a few years since covered
with wood.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But how is it that animal substances are reckoned to produce the best
manure? Does it not appear much more natural that the decomposed
elements of vegetables should be the most appropriate to the formation
of new vegetables?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The addition of a much greater proportion of nitrogen, which
constitutes the chief difference between animal and vegetable matter,
renders the composition of the former more complicated, and consequently
more favourable to decomposition. The use of animal substances is
chiefly to give the first impulse to the fermentation of the vegetable
ingredients that enter into the composition of manures. The manure of a
farm-yard is of that description; but there is scarcely any substance
susceptible of undergoing the putrid fermentation that will not make
good manure. The heat produced by the fermentation of manure is another
circumstance which is extremely favourable to vegetation; yet this heat
would be too great if the manure was laid on the ground during the
height of fermentation; it is used in this state only for hot-beds, to
produce melons, cucumbers,
<span class = "pagenum">249</span>
<a name = "page249" id = "page249"> </a>
and such vegetables as require a very high temperature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>A difficulty has just occurred to me which I do not know how to
remove. Since all organised bodies are, in the common course of nature,
ultimately reduced to their elementary state, they must necessarily in
that state enrich the soil, and afford food for vegetation. How is it,
then, that agriculture, which cannot increase the quantity of those
elements that are required to manure the earth, can increase its produce
so wonderfully as is found to be the case in all cultivated
countries?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is by suffering none of these decaying bodies to be dissipated,
but in applying them duly to the soil. It is by a judicious preparation
of the soil, which consists in fitting it either for the general
purposes of vegetation, or for that of the particular seed which is to
be sown. Thus, if the soil be too wet, it may be drained; if too loose
and sandy, it may be rendered more consistent and retentive of water by
the addition of clay or loam; it may be enriched by chalk, or any kind
of calcareous earth. On soils thus improved, manures will act with
double efficacy, and if attention be paid to spread them on the ground
at a proper season of the year, to mix them with
<span class = "pagenum">250</span>
<a name = "page250" id = "page250"> </a>
the soil so that they may be generally diffused through it, to destroy
the weeds which might appropriate these nutritive principles to their
own use, to remove the stones which would impede the growth of the
plant, &amp;c. we may obtain a produce an hundred fold more abundant
than the earth would spontaneously supply.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>We have a very striking instance of this in the scanty produce of
uncultivated commons, compared to the rich crops of meadows which are
occasionally manured.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But, Mrs. B., though experience daily proves the advantage of
cultivation, there is still a difficulty which I cannot get over.
A&nbsp;certain quantity of elementary principles exist in nature, which
it is not in the power of man either to augment or diminish. Of these
principles you have taught us that both the animal and vegetable
creation are composed. Now the more of them is taken up by the vegetable
kingdom, the less, it would seem, will remain for animals; and,
therefore, the more populous the earth becomes, the less it will
produce.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Your reasoning is very plausible; but experience
<span class = "pagenum">251</span>
<a name = "page251" id = "page251"> </a>
every where contradicts the inference you would draw from it; for we
find that the animal and vegetable kingdoms, instead of thriving, as you
would suppose, at each other’s expense, always increase and multiply
together. For you should recollect that animals can derive the elements
of which they are formed only through the medium of vegetables. And you
must allow that your conclusion would be valid only if every particle of
the several principles that could possibly be spared from other purposes
were employed in the animal and vegetable creations. Now we have reason
to believe that a much greater proportion of these principles than is
required for such purposes remains either in an elementary state, or
engaged in a less useful mode of combination in the mineral kingdom.
Possessed of such immense resources as the atmosphere and the waters
afford us, for oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon, so far from being in danger
of working up all our simple materials, we cannot suppose that we shall
ever bring agriculture to such a degree of perfection as to require the
whole of what these resources could supply.</p>

<p>Nature, however, in thus furnishing us with an inexhaustible stock of
raw materials, leaves it in some measure to the ingenuity of man to
appropriate them to its own purposes. But, like a kind parent, she
stimulates him to exertion, by setting
<span class = "pagenum">252</span>
<a name = "page252" id = "page252"> </a>
the example and pointing out the way. For it is on the operations of
nature that all the improvements of art are founded. The art of
agriculture consists, therefore, in discovering the readiest method of
obtaining the several principles, either from their grand sources, air
and water, or from the decomposition of organised bodies; and in
appropriating them in the best manner to the purposes of vegetation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But, among the sources of nutritive principles, I&nbsp;am surprised
that you do not mention the earth itself, as it contains abundance of
coals, which are chiefly composed of carbon.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Though coals abound in carbon, they cannot, on account of their
hardness and impermeable texture, be immediately subservient to the
purposes of vegetation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>No; but by their combustion carbonic acid is produced; and this
entering into various combinations on the surface of the earth, may,
perhaps, assist in promoting vegetation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Probably it may in some degree; but at any
<span class = "pagenum">253</span>
<a name = "page253" id = "page253"> </a>
rate the quantity of nourishment which vegetables may derive from that
source can be but very trifling, and must entirely depend on local
circumstances.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Perhaps the smoky atmosphere of London is the cause of vegetation
being so forward and so rich in its vicinity?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I rather believe that this circumstance proceeds from the very ample
supply of manure, assisted, perhaps, by the warmth and shelter which the
town affords. Far from attributing any good to the smoky atmosphere of
London, I&nbsp;confess I like to anticipate the time when we shall have
made such progress in the art of managing combustion, that every
particle of carbon will be consumed, and the smoke destroyed at the
moment of its production. We may then expect to have the satisfaction of
seeing the atmosphere of London as clear as that of the
country.&mdash;But to return to our subject: I&nbsp;hope that you are
now convinced that we shall not easily experience a deficiency of
nutritive elements to fertilise the earth, and that, provided we are but
industrious in applying them to the best advantage by improving the art
of agriculture, no limits can be assigned to the fruits that we may
expect to reap from our labours.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">254</span>
<a name = "page254" id = "page254"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes; I am perfectly satisfied in that respect, and I can assure you
that I feel already much more interested in the progress and improvement
of agriculture.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I have frequently thought that the culture of the land was not
considered as a concern of sufficient importance. Manufactures always
take the lead; and health and innocence are frequently sacrificed to the
prospect of a more profitable employment. It has often grieved me to see
the poor manufacturers crowded together in close rooms, and confined for
the whole day to the most uniform and sedentary employment, instead of
being engaged in that innocent and salutary kind of labour, which Nature
seems to have assigned to man for the immediate acquirement of comfort,
and for the preservation of his existence. I&nbsp;am sure that you agree
with me in thinking so, Mrs.&nbsp;B.?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I am entirely of your opinion, my dear, in regard to the importance
of agriculture; but as the conveniences of life, which we are all
enjoying, are not derived merely from the soil, I&nbsp;am far from
wishing to depreciate manufactures. Besides, as the labour of one man is
sufficient to produce food for several, those whose industry is not
<span class = "pagenum">255</span>
<a name = "page255" id = "page255"> </a>
required in tillage must do something in return for the food that is
provided for them. They exchange, consequently, the accommodations for
the necessaries of life. Thus the carpenter and the weaver lodge and
clothe the peasant, who supplies them with their daily bread. The
greater stock of provisions, therefore, which the husbandman produces,
the greater is the quantity of accommodation which the artificer
prepares. Such are the happy effects which naturally result from
civilised society. It would be wiser, therefore, to endeavour to improve
the situation of those who are engaged in manufactures, than to indulge
in vain declamations on the hardships to which they are too frequently
exposed.</p>

<p>But we must not yet take our leave of the subject of agriculture; we
have prepared the soil, it remains for us now to sow the seed. In this
operation we must be careful not to bury it too deep in the ground, as
the access of air is absolutely necessary to its germination; the earth
must, therefore, lie loose and light over it, in order that the air may
penetrate. Hence the use of ploughing and digging, harrowing and raking,
&amp;c. A&nbsp;certain degree of heat and moisture, such as usually
takes place in the spring, is likewise necessary.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>One would imagine you were going to describe
<span class = "pagenum">256</span>
<a name = "page256" id = "page256"> </a>
the decomposition of an old plant, rather than the formation of a new
one; for you have enumerated all the requisites of fermentation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Do you forget, my dear, that the young plant derives its existence
from the destruction of the seed, and that it is actually by the
saccharine fermentation that the latter is decomposed?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>True; I wonder that I did not recollect that. The temperature and
moisture required for the germination of the seed is then employed in
producing the saccharine fermentation within&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly. But, in order to understand the nature of germination, you
should be acquainted with the different parts of which the seed is
composed. The external covering or envelope contains, besides the germ
of the future plant, the substance which is to constitute its first
nourishment; this substance, which is called the <i>parenchyma</i>,
consists of fecula, mucilage, and oil, as we formerly observed.</p>

<p>The seed is generally divided into two compartments, called
<i>lobes</i>, or <i>cotyledons</i>, as is exemplified by this bean (<a
class = "smallcaps" href = "#plateXV">Plate XV.</a>
Fig.&nbsp;1.)&mdash;the dark-coloured
<span class = "pagenum">257</span>
<a name = "page257" id = "page257"> </a>
kind of string which divides the lobes is called the <i>radicle</i>, as
it forms the root of the plant, and it is from a contiguous substance,
called <i>plumula</i>, which is enclosed within the lobes, that the stem
arises. The figure and size of the seed depend very much upon the
cotyledons; these vary in number in different seeds; some have only one,
as wheat, oats, barley, and all the grasses; some have three, others
six. But most seeds, as, for instance, all the varieties of beans, have
two cotyledons. When the seed is buried in the earth, at any temperature
above 40 degrees, it imbibes water, which softens and swells the lobes;
it then absorbs oxygen, which combines with some of its carbon, and is
returned in the form of carbonic acid. This loss of carbon increases the
comparative proportion of hydrogen and oxygen in the seed, and excites
the saccharine fermentation, by which the parenchymatous matter is
converted into a kind of sweet emulsion. In this form it is carried into
the radicle by vessels appropriated to that purpose; and in the mean
time, the fermentation having caused the seed to burst, the cotyledons
are rent asunder, the radicle strikes into the ground and becomes the
root of the plant, and hence the fermented liquid is conveyed to the
plumula, whose vessels have been previously distended by the heat of the
fermentation. The plumula being thus swelled, as it were, by the
<span class = "pagenum">258</span>
<a name = "page258" id = "page258"> </a>
emulsive fluid, raises itself and springs up to the surface of the
earth, bearing with it the cotyledons, which, as soon as they come in
contact with the air, spread themselves, and are transformed into
leaves.&mdash;If we go into the garden, we shall probably find some

<p>Here are some lupines that are just making their appearance above
ground.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We shall take up several of them to observe their different degrees
of progress in vegetation. Here is one that has but recently burst its
envelope&mdash;do you see the little radicle striking downwards? (<a
class = "smallcaps" href = "#plateXV">Plate XV.</a> Fig.&nbsp;2.) In
this the plumula is not yet visible. But here is another in a greater
state of forwardness&mdash;the plumula, or stem, has risen out of the
ground, and the cotyledons are converted into seed leaves. (<a class =
"smallcaps" href = "#plateXV">Plate XV.</a> Fig.&nbsp;3.)</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>These leaves are very thick and clumsy, and unlike the other leaves,
which I perceive are just beginning to appear.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is because they retain the remains of the parenchyma,
<span class = "pagenum">259</span>
<a name = "page259" id = "page259"> </a>
with which they still continue to nourish the young plant, as it has not
yet sufficient roots and strength to provide for its sustenance from the
soil.&mdash;But, in this third lupine (<a class = "smallcaps" href =
"#plateXV">Plate <ins class = "mycorr" title =
"text reads ‘XIV’">XV</ins>.</a> Fig.&nbsp;4.), the radicle had sunk deep into the
earth, and sent out several shoots, each of which is furnished with a
mouth to suck up nourishment from the soil; the function of the original
leaves, therefore, being no longer required, they are gradually
decaying, and the plumula is become a regular stem, shooting out small
branches, and spreading its foliage.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>There seems to be a very striking analogy between a seed and an egg;
both require an elevation of temperature to be brought to life; both at
first supply with aliment the organised being which they produce; and as
soon as this has attained sufficient strength to procure its own
nourishment, the egg-shell breaks, whilst in the plant the seed-leaves
fall off.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There is certainly some resemblance between these processes; and when
you become acquainted with animal chemistry, you will frequently be
struck with its analogy to that of the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">260</span>
<a name = "page260" id = "page260"> </a>
<p>As soon as the young plant feeds from the soil, it requires the
assistance of leaves, which are the organs by which it throws off its
super-abundant fluid; this secretion is much more plentiful in the
vegetable than in the animal creation, and the great extent of surface
of the foliage of plants is admirably calculated for carrying it on in
sufficient quantities. This transpired fluid consists of little more
than water. The sap, by this process, is converted into a liquid of
greater consistence, which is fit to be assimilated to its several
parts.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Vegetation, then, must be essentially injured by destroying the
leaves of the plant?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly; it not only diminishes the transpiration, but also the
absorption by the roots; for the quantity of sap absorbed is always in
proportion to the quantity of fluid thrown off by transpiration. You
see, therefore, the necessity that a young plant should unfold its
leaves as soon as it begins to derive its nourishment from the soil;
and, accordingly, you will find that those lupines which have dropped
their seed-leaves, and are no longer fed by the parenchyma, have spread
their foliage, in order to perform the office just described.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">261</span>
<a name = "page261" id = "page261"> </a>
<p>But I should inform you that this function of transpiration seems to
be confined to the upper surface of the leaves, whilst, on the contrary,
the lower surface, which is more rough and uneven, and furnished with a
kind of hair or down, is destined to absorb moisture, or such other
ingredients as the plant derives from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>As soon as a young plant makes its appearance above ground, light, as
well as air, becomes necessary to its preservation. Light is essential
to the development of the colours, and to the thriving of the plant. You
may have often observed what a predilection vegetables have for the
light. If you make any plants grow in a room, they all spread their
leaves, and extend their branches towards the windows.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And many plants close up their flowers as soon as it is dark.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But may not this be owing to the cold and dampness of the evening
air?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That does not appear to be the case; for in a course of curious
experiments, made by Mr. Senebier, of Geneva, on plants which he reared
by
<span class = "pagenum">262</span>
<a name = "page262" id = "page262"> </a>
lamp-light, he found that the flowers closed their petals whenever the
lamps were extinguished.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But pray, why is air essential to vegetation, plants do not breathe
it like animals?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>At least not in the same manner; but they certainly derive some
principles from the atmosphere, and yield others to it. Indeed, it is
chiefly owing to the action of the atmosphere and the vegetable kingdom
on each other, that the air continues always fit for respiration. But
you will understand this better when I have explained the effect of
water on plants.</p>

<p>I have said that water forms the chief nourishment of plants; it is
the basis not only of the sap, but of all the vegetable juices. Water is
the vehicle which carries into the plant the various salts and other
ingredients required for the formation and support of the vegetable
system. Nor is this all; part of the water itself is decomposed by the
organs of the plant; the hydrogen becomes a constituent part of oil, of
extract, of colouring matter, &amp;c. whilst a portion of the oxygen
enters into the formation of mucilage, of fecula, of sugar, and of
vegetable acids. But the greater part of the oxygen, proceeding from the
decomposition
<span class = "pagenum">263</span>
<a name = "page263" id = "page263"> </a>
of the water, is converted into a gaseous state by the caloric
disengaged from the hydrogen during its condensation in the formation of
the vegetable materials. In this state the oxygen is transpired by the
leaves of plants when exposed to the sun’s rays. Thus you find that the
decomposition of water, by the organs of the plant, is not only a means
of supplying it with its chief ingredient, hydrogen, but at the same
time of replenishing the atmosphere with oxygen, a&nbsp;principle which
requires continual renovation, to make up for the great consumption of
it occasioned by the numerous oxygenations, combustions, and
respirations, that are constantly taking place on the surface of the
globe.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What a striking instance of the harmony of nature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And how admirable the design of Providence, who makes every different
part of the creation thus contribute to the support and renovation of
each other!</p>

<p>But the intercourse of the vegetable and animal kingdoms through the
medium of the atmosphere extends still further. Animals, in breathing,
not only consume the oxygen of the air, but load it with carbonic acid,
which, if accumulated in the atmosphere, would, in a short time, render
it
<span class = "pagenum">264</span>
<a name = "page264" id = "page264"> </a>
totally unfit for respiration. Here the vegetable kingdom again
interferes; it attracts and decomposes the carbonic acid, retains the
carbon for its own purposes, and returns the oxygen for ours.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How interesting this is! I do not know a more beautiful illustration
of the wisdom which is displayed in the laws of nature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Faint and imperfect as are the ideas which our limited perceptions
enable us to form of divine wisdom, still they cannot fail to inspire us
with awe and admiration. What, then, would be our feelings, were the
complete system of nature at once displayed before us! So magnificent a
scene would probably be too great for our limited and imperfect
comprehension, and it is no doubt among the wise dispensations of
Providence, to veil the splendour of a glory with which we should be
overpowered. But it is well suited to the nature of a rational being to
explore, step by step, the works of the creation, to endeavour to
connect them into harmonious systems; and, in a word, to trace in the
chain of beings, the kindred ties and benevolent design which unites its
various links, and secure its preservation.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">265</span>
<a name = "page265" id = "page265"> </a>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But of what nature are the organs of plants which are endued with
such wonderful powers?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They are so minute that their structure, as well as the mode in which
they perform their functions, generally elude our examination; but we
may consider them as so many vessels or <ins class = "mycorr" title =
"Latin plural form">apparatus</ins> appropriated to perform, with the
assistance of the principle of life, certain chemical processes, by
means of which these vegetable compounds are generated. We may, however,
trace the tannin, resins, gum, mucilage, and some other vegetable
materials, in the organised arrangement of plants, in which they form
the bark, the wood, the leaves, flowers, and seeds.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> is composed of the <i>epidermis</i>, the
<i>parenchyma</i>, and the <i>cortical layers</i>.</p>

<p>The epidermis is the external covering of the plant. It is a thin
transparent membrane, consisting of a number of slender fibres, crossing
each other, and forming a kind of net-work. When of a white glossy
nature, as in several species of trees, in the stems of corn and of
seeds, it is composed of a thin coating of siliceous earth, which
accounts for the strength and hardness of those long and slender stems.
Sir H. Davy was led to the discovery of the siliceous nature of the
epidermis of
<span class = "pagenum">266</span>
<a name = "page266" id = "page266"> </a>
such plants, by observing the singular phenomenon of sparks of fire
emitted by the collision of ratan canes with which two boys were
fighting in a dark room. On analysing the epidermis of the cane, he
found it to be almost entirely siliceous.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>With iron then, a&nbsp;cane, I suppose, will strike fire very
easily?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I understand that it will.&mdash;In ever-greens the epidermis is
mostly resinous, and in some few plants is formed of wax. The resin,
from its want of affinity for water, tends to preserve the plant from
the destructive effects of violent rains, severe climates, or inclement
seasons, to which this species of vegetables is peculiarly exposed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Resin must preserve wood just like a varnish, as it is the essential
ingredient of varnishes?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; and by this means it prevents likewise all unnecessary
expenditure of moisture.</p>

<p>The parenchyma is immediately beneath the epidermis; it is that green
rind which appears when you strip a branch of any tree or shrub of
<span class = "pagenum">267</span>
<a name = "page267" id = "page267"> </a>
its external coat of bark. The parenchyma is not confined to the stem or
branches, but extends over every part of the plant. It forms the green
matter of the leaves, and is composed of tubes filled with a peculiar
juice.</p>

<p>The cortical layers are immediately in contact with the wood; they
abound with tannin and gallic acid, and consist of small vessels through
which the sap descends after being elaborated in the leaves. The
cortical layers are annually renewed, the old bark being converted into
wood.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But through what vessels does the sap ascend?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That function is performed by the tubes of the alburnum, or wood,
which is immediately beneath the cortical layers. The wood is composed
of woody fibre, mucilage, and resin. The fibres are disposed in two
ways; some of them longitudinally, and these form what is called the
silver grain of the wood. The others, which are concentric, are called
the spurious grain. These last are disposed in layers, from the number
of which the age of the tree may be computed, a&nbsp;new one being
produced annually by the conversion of the bark into wood. The oldest,
and consequently most internal part of the alburnum, is called
<span class = "pagenum">268</span>
<a name = "page268" id = "page268"> </a>
heart-wood; it appears to be dead, at least no vital functions are
discernible in it. It is through the tubes of the living alburnum that
the sap rises. These, therefore, spread into the leaves, and there
communicate with the extremities of the vessels of the cortical layers,
into which they pour their contents.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Of what use, then, are the tubes of the parenchyma, since neither the
ascending nor descending sap passes through them?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They are supposed to perform the important function of secreting from
the sap the peculiar juices from which the plant more immediately
derives its nourishment. These juices are very conspicuous, as the
vessels which contain them are much larger than those through which the
sap circulates. The peculiar juices of plants differ much in their
nature, not only in different species of vegetables, but frequently in
different parts of the same individual plant: they are sometimes
saccharine, as in the sugar-cane, sometimes resinous, as in firs and
evergreens, sometimes of a milky appearance, as in the laurel.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I have often observed, that in breaking a young
<span class = "pagenum">269</span>
<a name = "page269" id = "page269"> </a>
shoot, or in bruising a leaf of laurel, a&nbsp;milky juice will ooze out
in great abundance.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And it is by making incisions in the bark that pitch, tar, and
turpentine are obtained from fir-trees. The durability of this species
of wood is chiefly owing to the resinous nature of its peculiar juices.
The volatile oils have, in a great measure, the same preservative
effects, as they defend the parts, with which they are connected, from
the attack of insects. This tribe seems to have as great an aversion to
perfumes, as the human species have delight in them. They scarcely ever
attack any odoriferous parts of plants, and it is not uncommon to see
every leaf of a tree destroyed by a blight, whilst the blossoms remain
untouched. Cedar, sandal, and all aromatic woods, are on this account of
great durability.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But the wood of the oak, which is so much esteemed for its
durability, has, I&nbsp;believe, no smell. Does it derive this quality
from its hardness alone?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not entirely; for the <ins class = "mycorr" title = "common variant spelling">chesnut</ins>,
though considerably harder and firmer than the
oak, is not so lasting. The durability of the oak is, I&nbsp;believe,
<span class = "pagenum">270</span>
<a name = "page270" id = "page270"> </a>
in a great measure owing to its having very little heart-wood, the
alburnum preserving its vital functions longer than in other trees.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>If incisions are made into the alburnum and cortical layers, may not
the ascending and descending sap be procured in the same manner as the
peculiar juice is from the vessels of the parenchyma?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but in order to obtain specimens of these fluids, in any
quantity, the experiment must be made in the spring, when the sap
circulates with the greatest energy. For this purpose a small bent glass
tube should be introduced into the incision, through which the sap may
flow without mixing with any of the other juices of the tree. From the
bark the sap will flow much more plentifully than from the wood, as the
ascending sap is much more liquid, more abundant, and more rapid in its
motion than that which descends; for the latter having been deprived by
the operation of the leaves of a considerable part of its moisture,
contains a much greater proportion of solid matter, which retards its
motion. It does not appear that there is any excess of descending sap,
as none ever exudes from the roots of plants; this process, therefore,
seems to be carried on only in
<span class = "pagenum">271</span>
<a name = "page271" id = "page271"> </a>
proportion to the wants of the plant, and the sap descends no further,
and in no greater quantity, than is required to nourish the several
organs. Therefore, though the sap rises and descends in the plant, it
does not appear to undergo a real circulation.</p>

<p>The last of the organs of plants is the <i>flower</i>, or
<i>blossom</i>, which produces the <i>fruits</i> and <i>seed</i>. These
may be considered as the ultimate purpose of nature in the vegetable
creation. From fruits and seeds animals derive both a plentiful source
of immediate nourishment, and an ample provision for the reproduction of
the same means of subsistence.</p>

<p>The seed which forms the final product of mature plants, we have
already examined as constituting the first rudiments of future
vegetation.</p>

<p>These are the principal organs of vegetation, by means of which the
several chemical processes which are carried on during the life of the
plant are performed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But how are the several principles which enter into the composition
of vegetables so combined by the organs of the plant as to be converted
into vegetable matter?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By chemical processes, no doubt; but the apparatus in which they are
performed is so extremely
<span class = "pagenum">272</span>
<a name = "page272" id = "page272"> </a>
minute as completely to elude our examination. We can form an opinion,
therefore, only by the result of these operations. The sap is evidently
composed of water, absorbed by the roots, and holding in solution the
various principles which it derives from the soil. From the roots the
sap ascends through the tubes of the alburnum into the stem, and thence
branches out to every extremity of the plant. Together with the sap
circulates a certain quantity of carbonic acid, which is gradually
disengaged from the former by the internal heat of the plant.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What! have vegetables a peculiar heat, analogous to animal heat?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is a circumstance that has long been suspected; but late
experiments have decided beyond a doubt that vegetable heat is
considerably above that of unorganised matter in winter, and below it in
summer. The wood of a tree is about sixty degrees, when the thermometer
is seventy or eighty degrees. And the bark, though so much exposed, is
seldom below forty in winter.</p>

<p>It is from the sap, after it has been elaborated by the leaves, that
vegetables derive their nourishment; in its progress through the plant
from the
<span class = "pagenum">273</span>
<a name = "page273" id = "page273"> </a>
leaves to the roots, it deposits in the several sets of vessels with
which it communicates, the materials on which the growth and nourishment
of each plant depends. It is thus that the various peculiar juices,
saccharine, oily, mucous, acid, and colouring, are formed; as also the
more solid parts, fecula, woody fibre, tannin, resins, concrete salts;
in a word, all the immediate materials of vegetables, as well as the
organised parts of plants, which latter, besides the power of secreting
these from the sap for the general purpose of the plant, have also that
of applying them to their own particular nourishment.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But why should the process of vegetation take place only at one
season of the year, whilst a total inaction prevails during the
other?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Heat is such an important chemical agent, that its effect, as such,
might perhaps alone account for the impulse which the spring gives to
vegetation. But, in order to explain the mechanism of that operation, it
has been supposed that the warmth of the spring dilates the vessels of
plants, and produces a kind of vacuum, into which the sap (which had
remained in a state of inaction in the trunk during the winter) rises:
this is followed by the
<span class = "pagenum">274</span>
<a name = "page274" id = "page274"> </a>
ascent of the sap contained in the roots, and room is thus made for
fresh sap, which the roots, in their turn, pump up from the soil. This
process goes on till the plant blossoms and bears fruit, which
terminates its summer career: but when the cold weather sets in, the
fibres and vessels contract, the leaves wither, and are no longer able
to perform their office of transpiration; and, as this secretion stops,
the roots cease to absorb sap from the soil. If the plant be an annual,
its life then terminates; if not, it remains in a state of torpid
inaction during the winter; or the only internal motion that takes place
is that of a small quantity of resinous juice, which slowly rises from
the stem into the branches, and enlarges their buds during the
winter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yet, in evergreens, vegetation must continue throughout the year.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but in winter it goes on in a very imperfect manner, compared to
the vegetation of spring and summer.</p>

<p>We have dwelt much longer on the history of vegetable chemistry than
I had intended; but we have at length, I&nbsp;think, brought the subject
to a conclusion.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">275</span>
<a name = "page275" id = "page275"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I rather wonder that you did not reserve the account of the
fermentations for the conclusion; for the decomposition of vegetables
naturally follows their death, and can hardly, it seems, be introduced
with so much propriety at any other period.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine at what point precisely it may be most
eligible to enter on the history of vegetation; every part of the
subject is so closely connected, and forms such an uninterrupted chain,
that it is by no means easy to divide it. Had I begun with the
germination of the seed, which, at first view, seems to be the most
proper arrangement, I&nbsp;could not have explained the nature and
fermentation of the seed, or have described the changes which manure
must undergo, in order to yield the vegetable elements. To understand
the nature of germination, it is necessary, I&nbsp;think, previously to
decompose the parent plant, in order to become acquainted with the
materials required for that purpose. I&nbsp;hope, therefore, that, upon
second consideration, you will find that the order which I have adopted,
though apparently less correct, is in fact the best calculated for the
elucidation of the subject.</p>

chemistry, which comprehends the most complicated order of compound
beings. This is the animal creation, the history of which cannot but
excite the highest degree of curiosity and interest, though we often
fail in attempting to explain the laws by which it is governed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But since all animals ultimately derive their nourishment from
vegetables, the chemistry of this order of beings must consist merely in
the conversion of vegetable into animal matter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very true; but the manner in which this is effected is, in a great
measure, concealed from our observation. This process is called
<i>animalisation</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">277</span>
<a name = "page277" id = "page277"> </a>
and is performed by peculiar organs. The difference of the animal and
vegetable kingdoms does not however depend merely on a different
arrangement of combinations. A&nbsp;new principle abounds in the animal
kingdom, which is but rarely and in very small quantities found in
vegetables; this is nitrogen. There is likewise in animal substances a
greater and more constant proportion of phosphoric acid, and other
saline matters. But these are not essential to the formation of animal
matter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Animal compounds contain, then, four fundamental principles; oxygen,
hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; and these form the immediate materials of animals, which are
<i>gelatine</i>, <i>albumen</i>, and <i>fibrine</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Are those all? I am surprised that animals should be composed of
fewer kinds of materials than vegetables; for they appear much more
complicated in their organisation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Their organisation is certainly more perfect and intricate, and the
ingredients that occasionally
<span class = "pagenum">278</span>
<a name = "page278" id = "page278"> </a>
enter into their composition are more numerous. But notwithstanding the
wonderful variety observable in the texture of the animal organs, we
find that the original compounds, from which all the varieties of animal
matter are derived, may be reduced to the three heads just mentioned.
Animal substances being the most complicated of all natural compounds,
are most easily susceptible of decomposition, as the scale of
attractions increases in proportion to the number of constituent
principles. Their analysis is, however, both difficult and imperfect;
for as they cannot be examined in their living state, and are liable to
alteration immediately after death, it is probable that, when submitted
to the investigation of a chemist, they are always more or less altered
in their combinations and properties, from what they were, whilst they
made part of the living animal.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The mere diminution of temperature, which they experience by the
privation of animal heat, must, I&nbsp;should suppose, be sufficient to
derange the order of attractions that existed during life.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is one of the causes, no doubt: but there are many other
circumstances which prevent us from studying the nature of living animal
substances.
<span class = "pagenum">279</span>
<a name = "page279" id = "page279"> </a>
We must therefore, in a considerable degree, confine our researches to
the phenomena of these compounds in their inanimate state.</p>

<p>These three kinds of animal matter, gelatine, albumen, and fibrine,
form the basis of all the various parts of the animal system; either
solid, as the <i>skin</i>, <i>flesh</i>, <i>nerves</i>,
<i>membranes</i>, <i>cartilages</i>, and <i>bones</i>; or fluid, as
<i>blood</i>, <i>chyle</i>, <i>milk</i>, <i>mucus</i>, the
<i>gastric</i> and <i>pancreatic juices</i>, <i>bile</i>,
<i>perspiration</i>, <i>saliva</i>, <i>tears</i>,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is it not surprising that so great a variety of substances, and so
different in their nature, should yet all arise from so few materials,
and from the same original elements?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The difference in the nature of various bodies depends, as I have
often observed to you, rather on their state of combination, than on the
materials of which they are composed. Thus, in considering the chemical
nature of the creation in a general point of view, we observe that it is
throughout composed of a very small number of elements. But when we
divide it into the three kingdoms, we find that, in the mineral, the
combinations seem to result from the union of elements casually brought
together; whilst in the
<span class = "pagenum">280</span>
<a name = "page280" id = "page280"> </a>
vegetable and animal kingdoms, the attractions are peculiarly and
regularly produced by appropriate organs, whose action depends on the
vital principle. And we may further observe, that by means of certain
spontaneous changes and decompositions, the elements of one kind of
matter become subservient to the reproduction of another; so that the
three kingdoms are intimately connected, and constantly contributing to
the preservation of each other.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>There is, however, one very considerable class of elements, which
seems to be confined to the mineral kingdom: I&nbsp;mean metals.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not entirely; they are found, though in very minute quantities, both
in the vegetable and animal kingdoms. A&nbsp;small portion of earths and
sulphur enters also into the composition of organised bodies.
Phosphorus, however, is almost entirely confined to the animal kingdom;
and nitrogen, but with few exceptions, is extremely scarce in
vegetables.</p>

<p>Let us now proceed to examine the nature of the three principal
materials of the animal system.</p>

<p><i>Gelatine</i>, or <i>jelly</i>, is the chief ingredient of skin,
<span class = "pagenum">281</span>
<a name = "page281" id = "page281"> </a>
and of all the membranous parts of animals. It may be obtained from
these substances, by means of boiling water, under the forms of glue,
size, isinglass, and transparent jelly.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But these are of a very different nature; they cannot therefore be
all pure gelatine.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not entirely, but very nearly so. Glue is extracted from the skin of
animals. Size is obtained either from skin in its natural state, or from
leather. Isinglass is gelatine procured from a particular species of
fish; it is, you know, of this substance that the finest jelly is made,
and this is done by merely dissolving the isinglass in boiling water,
and allowing the solution to congeal.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The wine, lemon, and spices, are, I suppose, added only to flavour
the jelly?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Exactly so.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But jelly is often made of hartshorn shavings, and of calves’ feet;
do these substances contain gelatine?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">282</span>
<a name = "page282" id = "page282"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes. Gelatine may be obtained from almost any animal substance, as it
enters more or less into the composition of all of them. The process for
obtaining it is extremely simple, as it consists merely in boiling the
substance that contains it with water. The gelatine dissolves in water,
and may be attained of any degree of consistence or strength, by
evaporating this solution. Bones in particular produce it very
plentifully, as they consist of phosphat of lime combined or cemented by
gelatine. Horns, which are a species of bone, will yield abundance of
gelatine. The horns of the hart are reckoned to produce gelatine of the
finest quality; they are reduced to the state of shavings in order that
the jelly may be more easily extracted by the water. It is of hartshorn
shavings that the jellies for invalids are usually made, as they are of
very easy digestion.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It appears singular that hartshorn, which yields such a powerful
ingredient as ammonia, should at the same time produce so mild and
insipid a substance as jelly?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And (what is more surprising) it is from the gelatine of bones that
ammonia is produced. You
<span class = "pagenum">283</span>
<a name = "page283" id = "page283"> </a>
must observe, however, that the processes by which these two substances
are obtained from bones are very different. By the simple action of
water and heat, the gelatine is separated; but in order to procure the
ammonia, or what is commonly called hartshorn, the bones must be
distilled, by which means the gelatine is decomposed, and hydrogen and
nitrogen combined in the form of ammonia. So that the first operation is
a mere separation of ingredients, whilst the second requires a chemical
decomposition.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But when jelly is made from hartshorn shavings, what becomes of the
phosphat of lime which constitutes the other part of bones?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is easily separated by straining. But the jelly is afterwards more
perfectly purified, and rendered transparent, by adding white of egg,
which being coagulated by heat, rises to the surface along with any
impurities.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I wonder that bones are not used by the common people to make jelly;
a&nbsp;great deal of wholesome nourishment, might, I&nbsp;should
suppose, be procured from them, though the jelly would perhaps
<span class = "pagenum">284</span>
<a name = "page284" id = "page284"> </a>
not be quite so good as if made from hartshorn shavings?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There is a prejudice among the poor against a species of food that is
usually thrown to the dogs; and as we cannot expect them to enter into
chemical considerations, it is in some degree excusable. Besides, it
requires a prodigious quantity of fuel to dissolve bones and obtain the
gelatine from them.</p>

<p>The solution of bones in water is greatly promoted by an accumulation
of heat. This may be effected by means of an extremely strong metallic
vessel, called <i>Papin’s digester</i>, in which the bones and water are
enclosed, without any possibility of the steam making its escape.
A&nbsp;heat can thus be applied much superior to that of boiling water;
and bones, by this means, are completely reduced to a pulp. But the
process still consumes too much fuel to be generally adopted among the
lower classes.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And why should not a manufacture be established for grinding or
macerating bones, or at least for reducing them to the state of
shavings, when I suppose they would dissolve as readily as hartshorn
shavings?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">285</span>
<a name = "page285" id = "page285"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They could not be collected clean for such a purpose, but they are
not lost, as they are used for making hartshorn and sal ammoniac; and
such is the superior science and industry of this country, that we now
send sal ammoniac to the Levant, though it originally came to us from
Egypt.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>When jelly is made of isinglass, does it leave no sediment?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; nor does it so much require clarifying, as it consists almost
entirely of pure <ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘gelantine’">gelatine</ins>,
and any foreign matter that is mixed with
it, is thrown off during the boiling in the form of scum.&mdash;These
are processes which you may see performed in great perfection in the
culinary laboratory, by that very able and most useful chemist the
cook.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>To what an immense variety of purposes chemistry is subservient!</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It appears, in that respect, to have an advantage over most other
arts and sciences; for these, very often, have a tendency to confine the
imagination
<span class = "pagenum">286</span>
<a name = "page286" id = "page286"> </a>
to their own particular object, whilst the pursuit of chemistry is so
extensive and diversified, that it inspires a general curiosity, and a
desire of enquiring into the nature of every object.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I suppose that soup is likewise composed of gelatine; for, when cold,
it often assumes the consistence of jelly?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not entirely; for though soups generally contain a quantity of
gelatine, the most essential ingredient is a mucous or extractive
matter, a&nbsp;peculiar animal substance, very soluble in water, which
has a strong taste, and is more nourishing than gelatine. The various
kinds of portable soup consist of this extractive matter in a dry state,
which, in order to be made into soup, requires only to be dissolved in
water.</p>

<p>Gelatine, in its solid state, is a semiductile transparent substance,
without either taste or smell.&mdash;When exposed to heat, in contact
with air and water, it first swells, then fuses, and finally burns. You
may have seen the first part of this operation performed in the
carpenter’s glue-pot.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But you said that gelatine had no smell, and glue has a very
disagreeable one.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">287</span>
<a name = "page287" id = "page287"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Glue is not pure gelatine; as it is not designed for eating, it is
prepared without attending to the state of the ingredients, which are
more or less contaminated by particles that have become putrid.</p>

<p>Gelatine may be precipitated from its solution in water by
alcohol.&mdash;We shall try this experiment with a glass of warm
jelly.&mdash;You see that the gelatine subsides by the union of the
alcohol and the water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>How is it, then, that jelly is flavoured with wine, without producing
any precipitation?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because the alcohol contained in wine is already combined with water,
and other ingredients, and is therefore not at liberty to act upon the
jelly as when in its separate state. Gelatine is soluble both in acids
and in alkalies; the former, you know, are frequently used to season
jellies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Among the combinations of gelatine we must not forget one which you
formerly mentioned; that with tannin, to form leather.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">288</span>
<a name = "page288" id = "page288"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>True; but you must observe that leather can be produced only by
gelatine in a membranous state; for though pure gelatine and tannin will
produce a substance chemically similar to leather, yet the texture of
the skin is requisite to make it answer the useful purposes of that
substance.</p>

<p>The next animal substance we are to examine is <i>albumen</i>; this,
although constituting a part of most of the animal compounds, is
frequently found insulated in the animal system; the white of egg, for
instance, consists almost entirely of albumen; the substance that
composes the nerves, the serum, or white part of the blood, and the
curds of milk, are little else than albumen variously modified.</p>

<p>In its most simple state, albumen appears in the form of a
transparent viscous fluid, possessed of no distinct taste or smell; it
coagulates at the low temperature of 165 degrees, and, when once
solidified, it will never return to its fluid state.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid and alcohol are each of them capable of coagulating
albumen in the same manner as heat, as I am going to show you.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Exactly so.&mdash;Pray, Mrs. B., what kind of action
<span class = "pagenum">289</span>
<a name = "page289" id = "page289"> </a>
is there between albumen and silver? I&nbsp;have sometimes observed,
that if the spoon with which I eat an egg happens to be wetted, it
becomes tarnished.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is because the white of egg (and, indeed, albumen in general)
contains a little sulphur, which, at the temperature of an egg just
boiled, will decompose the drop of water that wets the spoon, and
produce sulphurated hydrogen gas, which has the property of tarnishing
silver.</p>

<p>We may now proceed to <i>fibrine</i>. This is an insipid and
inodorous substance, having somewhat the appearance of fine white
threads adhering together; it is the essential constituent of muscles or
flesh, in which it is mixed with and softened by gelatine. It is
insoluble both in water and alcohol, but sulphuric acid converts it into
a substance very analogous to gelatine.</p>


<p class = "space">
These are the essential and general ingredients of animal matter; but
there are other substances, which, though not peculiar to the animal
system, usually enter into its composition, such as oils, acids,
salts,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Animal oil</i> is the chief constituent of fat; it is contained in
abundance in the cream of milk, whence it is obtained in the form of
butter.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">290</span>
<a name = "page290" id = "page290"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is animal oil the same in its composition as vegetable oils?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not the same, but very analogous. The chief difference is that animal
oil contains nitrogen, a&nbsp;principle which seldom enters into the
composition of vegetable oils, and never in so large a proportion.</p>

<p>There are a few animal acids, that is to say, acids peculiar to
animal matter, from which they are almost exclusively obtained.</p>

<p>The animal acids have triple bases of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen.
Some of them are found native in animal matter; others are produced
during its decomposition.</p>

<p>Those that we find ready formed are:</p>

<p>The <i>bombic acid</i>, which is obtained from silk-worms.</p>

<p>The <i>formic acid</i>, from ants.</p>

<p>The <i>lactic acid</i>, from the whey of milk.</p>

<p>The <i>sebacic</i>, from oil or fat.</p>

<p>Those produced during the decomposition of animal substances by heat,
are the <i>prussic</i> and <i>zoonic</i> acids. This last is produced by
the roasting of meat, and gives it a brisk flavour.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">291</span>
<a name = "page291" id = "page291"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The class of animal acids is not very extensive?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; nor are they, generally speaking, of great importance. The
<i>prussic acid</i> is, I&nbsp;think, the only one sufficiently
interesting to require any further comment. It can be formed by any
artificial process, without the presence of any animal matter; and it
may likewise be obtained from a variety of vegetables, particularly
those of the narcotic kind, such as poppies, laurel, &amp;c. But it is
commonly obtained from blood, by strongly heating that substance with
caustic potash; the alkali attracts the acid from the blood, and forms
with it a <i>prussiat of potash</i>. From this state of combination the
prussic acid can be obtained pure by means of other substances which
have the power of separating it from the alkali.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But if this acid does not exist ready formed in blood, how can the
alkali attract it from&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is the triple basis only of this acid that exists in the blood;
and this is developed and brought to the state of acid, during the
combustion. The
<span class = "pagenum">292</span>
<a name = "page292" id = "page292"> </a>
acid therefore is first formed, and it afterwards combines with the
potash.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Now I comprehend it. But how can the prussic acid be artificially
made?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By passing ammoniacal gas over red-hot charcoal; and hence we learn
that the constituents of this acid are hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon.
The two first are derived from the volatile alkali, the last from the
combustion of the charcoal.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But this does not accord with the system of oxygen being the
principle of acidity.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The colouring matter of prussian blue is called an acid, because it
unites with alkalies and metals, and not from any other characteristic
properties of acids; perhaps the name is not strictly appropriate. But
this circumstance, together with some others of the same kind, has
induced several chemists to think that oxygen may not be the exclusive
generator of acids. Sir H. Davy, I&nbsp;have already informed you, was
led by his experiments
<span class = "pagenum">293</span>
<a name = "page293" id = "page293"> </a>
on dry acids to suspect that water might be essential to acidity. And it
is the opinion of some chemists that acidity may possibly depend rather
on the arrangement than on the presence of any particular principles.
But we have not yet done with the prussic acid. It has a strong affinity
for metallic oxyds, and precipitates the solutions of iron in acids of a
blue colour. This is the prussian blue, or prussiat of iron, so much
used in the arts, and with which I think you must be acquainted.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes, I am; it is much used in painting, both in oil and in water
colours; but it is not reckoned a permanent oil-colour.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That defect arises, I believe, in general, from its being badly
prepared, which is the case when the iron is not so fully oxydated as to
form a red oxyd. For a solution of green oxyd of iron (in which the
metal is more slightly oxydated), makes only a pale green, or even a
white precipitate, with prussiat of potash; and this gradually changes
to blue by being exposed to the air, as I can immediately show you.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">294</span>
<a name = "page294" id = "page294"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It already begins to assume a pale blue colour. But how does the air
produce this change?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By oxydating the iron more perfectly. If we pour some nitrous acid on
it, the prussian blue colour will be immediately produced, as the acid
will yield its oxygen to the precipitate, and fully saturate it with
this principle, as you shall see.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is very curious to see a colour change so instantaneously.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Hence you perceive that prussian blue cannot be a permanent colour,
unless prepared with red oxyd of iron, since by exposure to the
atmosphere it gradually darkens, and in a short time is no longer in
harmony with the other colours of the painting.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But it can never become darker, by exposure to the atmosphere, than
the true prussian blue, in which the oxyd is perfectly saturated?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly not. But in painting, the artist not
<span class = "pagenum">295</span>
<a name = "page295" id = "page295"> </a>
reckoning upon partial alterations in his colours, gives his blue tints
that particular shade which harmonises with the rest of the picture. If,
afterwards, those tints become darker, the harmony of the colouring must
necessarily be destroyed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Pray, of what nature is the paint called <i>carmine</i>?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is an animal colour prepared from <i>cochineal</i>, an insect, the
infusion of which produces a very beautiful red.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Whilst we are on the subject of colours, I&nbsp;should like to learn
what <i>ivory black</i>&nbsp;is?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is a carbonaceous substance obtained by the combustion of ivory.
A&nbsp;more common species of black is obtained from the burning of
bone.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But during the combustion of ivory or bone, the carbon, I&nbsp;should
have imagined, must be converted into carbonic acid gas, instead of this
black substance?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">296</span>
<a name = "page296" id = "page296"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>In this, as in most combustions, a considerable part of the carbon is
simply volatilised by the heat, and again obtained concrete on cooling.
This colour, therefore, may be called the soot produced by the burning
of ivory or bone.</p>

<p>The <i>bones</i> are the most solid part of the animal frame, and in

I&nbsp;suppose, what are the ingredients which enter into their
composition?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes; phosphat of lime, cemented by gelatine.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>During the earliest period of animal life, they consist almost
entirely of gelatinous membrane having the form of the bones, but of a
loose spongy texture, the cells or cavities of which are destined to be
filled with phosphat of lime; it is the gradual acquisition of this salt
which gives to the bones their subsequent hardness and durability.
Infants first receive it from their mother’s milk, and afterwards derive
it from all animal and from most vegetable food, especially farinaceous
substances, such as wheat-flour, which contain it in sensible
quantities. A&nbsp;portion of the phosphat, after the bones of the
infant have been sufficiently expanded and solidified, is deposited in
the teeth, which consist at first only of a gelatinous membrane or case,
fitted for the reception of this salt; and which, after acquiring
hardness within the gum, gradually protrude from&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How very curious this is; and how ingeniously
<span class = "pagenum">300</span>
<a name = "page300" id = "page300"> </a>
nature has first provided for the solidification of such bones as are
immediately wanted, and afterwards for the formation of the teeth, which
would not only be useless, but detrimental in infancy!</p>

<p>In quadrupeds the phosphat of lime is deposited likewise in their
horns, and in the hair or wool with which they are generally
clothed.</p>

<p>In birds it serves also to harden the beaks and the quills of their
feathers.</p>

<p>When animals are arrived at a state of maturity, and their bones have
acquired a sufficient degree of solidity, the phosphat of lime which is
taken with the food is seldom assimilated, excepting when the female
nourishes her young; it is then all secreted into the milk, as a
provision for the tender bones of the nursling.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>So that whatever becomes superfluous to one being, is immediately
wanted by another; and the child acquires strength precisely by the
species of nourishment which is no longer necessary to the mother.
Nature is, indeed, an admirable economist!</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Pray, Mrs. B., does not the disease in the bones
<span class = "pagenum">301</span>
<a name = "page301" id = "page301"> </a>
of children, called the rickets, proceed from a deficiency of phosphat
of lime?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I have heard that this disease may arise from two causes; it is
sometimes occasioned by the growth of the muscles being too rapid in
proportion to that of the bones. In this case the weight of the flesh is
greater than the bones can support, and presses upon them so as to
produce a swelling of the joints, which is the great indication of the
rickets. The other cause of this disorder is supposed to be an imperfect
digestion and assimilation of the food, attended with an excess of acid,
which counteracts the formation of phosphat of lime. In both instances,
therefore, care should be taken to alter the child’s diet, not merely by
increasing the quantity of aliment containing phosphat of lime, but also
by avoiding all food that is apt to turn acid on the stomach, and to
produce indigestion. But the best preservative against complaints of
this kind is, no doubt, good nursing: when a child has plenty of air and
exercise, the digestion and assimilation will be properly performed, no
acid will be produced to interrupt these functions, and the muscles and
bones will grow together in just proportions.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">302</span>
<a name = "page302" id = "page302"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I have often heard the rickets attributed to bad nursing, but I never
could have guessed what connection there was between exercise and the
formation of the bones.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Exercise is generally beneficial to all the animal functions. If man
is destined to labour for his subsistence, the bread which he earns is
scarcely more essential to his health and preservation than the
exertions by which he obtains it. Those whom the gifts of fortune have
placed above the necessity of bodily labour are compelled to take
exercise in some mode or other, and when they cannot convert it into an
amusement, they must submit to it as a task, or their health will soon
experience the effects of their indolence.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That will never be my case: for exercise, unless it becomes fatigue,
always gives me pleasure; and, so far from being a task, is to me a
source of daily enjoyment. I&nbsp;often think what a blessing it is,
that exercise, which is so conducive to health, should be so delightful;
whilst fatigue, which is rather hurtful, instead of pleasure, occasions
painful sensations. So that fatigue, no doubt, was
<span class = "pagenum">303</span>
<a name = "page303" id = "page303"> </a>
intended to moderate our bodily exertions, as satiety puts a limit to
our appetites.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly.&mdash;But let us not deviate too far from our
subject.&mdash;The bones are connected together by ligaments, which
consist of a white thick flexible substance, adhering to their
extremities, so far as to secure the joints firmly, though without
impeding their motion. And the joints are moreover covered by a solid,
smooth, elastic, white substance, called <i>cartilage</i>, the use of
which is to allow, by its smoothness and elasticity, the bones to slide
easily over one another, so that the joints may perform their office
without difficulty or detriment.</p>

<p>Over the bones the <i>muscles</i> are placed; they consist of bundles
of fibres which terminate in a kind of string, or ligament, by which
they are fastened to the bones. The muscles are the organs of motion; by
their power of dilatation and contraction they put into action the
bones, which act as levers, in all the motions of the body, and form the
solid support of its various parts. The muscles are of various degrees
of strength or consistence in different species of animals. The
mammiferous tribe, or those that suckle their young, seem in this
respect to occupy an intermediate place between birds and cold-blooded
animals, such as reptiles and fishes.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">304</span>
<a name = "page304" id = "page304"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The different degrees of firmness and solidity in the muscles of
these several species of animals proceed, I&nbsp;imagine, from the
different nature of the food on which they subsist?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; that is not supposed to be the case: for the human species, who
are of the mammiferous tribe, live on more substantial food than birds,
and yet the latter exceed them in muscular strength. We shall hereafter
attempt to account for this difference; but let us now proceed in the
examination of the animal functions.</p>

<p>The next class of organs is that of the <i>vessels</i> of the body,
the office of which is to convey the various fluids throughout the
frame. These vessels are innumerable. The most considerable of them are
those through which the blood circulates, which are of two kinds: the
<i>arteries</i>, which convey it from the heart to the extremities of
the body, and the <i>veins</i>, which bring it back into the heart.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are a numerous set of small transparent vessels,
destined to absorb and convey different fluids into the blood; they are
generally called the <i>absorbent</i> or <i>lymphatic</i> vessels: but
it is to a portion of them only that the function of conveying into the
blood the fluid called <i>lymph</i> is assigned.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray what is the nature of that fluid?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">305</span>
<a name = "page305" id = "page305"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The nature and use of the lymph have, I believe, never been perfectly
ascertained; but it is supposed to consist of matter that has been
previously animalised, and which, after answering the purpose for which
it was intended, must, in regular rotation, make way for the fresh
supplies produced by nourishment. The lymphatic vessels pump up this
fluid from every part of the system, and convey it into the veins to be
mixed with the blood which runs through them, and which is commonly
called venous blood.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But does it not again enter into the animal system through that
channel?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not entirely; for the venous blood does not return into the
circulation until it has undergone a peculiar change, in which it throws
off whatever is become useless.</p>

<p>Another set of absorbent vessels pump up the <i>chyle</i> from the
stomach and intestines, and convey it, after many circumvolutions, into
the great vein near the heart.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray what is chyle?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">306</span>
<a name = "page306" id = "page306"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is the substance into which food is converted by digestion.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>One set of the absorbent vessels, then, is employed in bringing away
the old materials that are no longer fit for use; whilst the other set
is busy in conveying into the blood the new materials that are to
replace them.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What a great variety of ingredients must enter into the composition
of the blood?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You must observe that there is also a great variety of substances to
be secreted from it. We may compare the blood to a general receptacle or
storehouse for all kinds of commodities, which are afterwards fashioned,
arranged, and disposed of as circumstances require.</p>

<p>There is another set of absorbent vessels in females which is
destined to secrete milk for the nourishment of the young.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray is not milk very analogous in its composition to blood; for,
since the nursling derives its nourishment from that source only, it
must contain
<span class = "pagenum">307</span>
<a name = "page307" id = "page307"> </a>
every principle which the animal system requires?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very true. Milk is found, by its analysis, to contain the principal
materials of animal matter, albumen, oil, and phosphat of lime; so that
the suckling has but little trouble to digest and assimilate this
nourishment. But we shall examine the composition of milk more fully
afterwards.</p>

<p>In many parts of the body numbers of small vessels are collected
together in little bundles called <i>glands</i>, from a Latin word
meaning acorn, on account of the resemblance which some of them bear in
shape to that fruit. The function of the glands is to <i>secrete</i>, or
separate certain matters from the blood.</p>

<p>The secretions are not only mechanical, but chemical separations from
the blood; for the substances thus formed, though contained in the
blood, are not ready combined in that fluid. The secretions are of two
kinds, those which form peculiar animal fluids, as bile, tears, saliva,
&amp;c.; and those which produce the general materials of the animal
system, for the purpose of recruiting and nourishing the several organs
of the body; such as albumen, gelatine, and fibrine; the latter may be
distinguished by the name of <i>nutritive secretions</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">308</span>
<a name = "page308" id = "page308"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I am quite astonished to hear that all the secretions should be
derived from the blood.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I thought that the bile was produced by the liver?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>So it is; but the liver is nothing more than a very large gland,
which secretes the bile from the blood.</p>

<p>The last of the animal organs which we have mentioned are the
<i>nerves</i>; these are the vehicles of sensation, every other part of
the body being, of itself, totally insensible.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>They must then be spread through every part of the frame, for we are
every where susceptible of feeling.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Excepting the nails and the hair.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And those are almost the only parts in which nerves cannot be
discovered. The common source of all the nerves is the brain; thence
they descend, some of them through different holes of the skull, but the
greatest part through the back bone,
<span class = "pagenum">309</span>
<a name = "page309" id = "page309"> </a>
and extend themselves by innumerable ramifications throughout the whole
body. They spread themselves over the muscles, penetrate the glands,
wind round the vascular system, and even pierce into the interior of the
bones. It is most probably through them that the communication is
carried on between the mind and the other parts of the body; but in what
manner they are acted on by the mind, and made to re-act on the body, is
still a profound secret. Many hypotheses have been formed on this very
obscure subject, but they are all equally improbable, and it would be
useless for us to waste our time in conjectures on an enquiry, which, in
all probability, is beyond the reach of human capacity.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But you have not mentioned those particular nerves that form the
senses of hearing, seeing, smelling, and tasting?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They are considered as being of the same nature as those which are
dispersed over every part of the body, and constitute the general sense
of feeling. The different sensations which they produce arise from their
peculiar situation and connection with the several organs of taste,
smell, and hearing.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">310</span>
<a name = "page310" id = "page310"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But these senses appear totally different from that of feeling?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They are all of them sensations, but variously modified according to
the nature of the different organs in which the nerves are situated.
For, as we have formerly observed, it is by contact only that the nerves
are affected. Thus odoriferous particles must strike upon the nerves of
the nose, in order to excite the sense of smelling; in the same manner
that taste is produced by the particular substance coming in contact
with the nerves of the palate. It is thus also that the sensation of
sound is produced by the concussion of the air striking against the
auditory nerve; and sight is the effect of the light falling upon the
optic nerve. These various senses, therefore, are affected only by the
actual contact of particles of matter, in the same manner as that of
feeling.</p>

<p>The different organs of the animal body, though easily separated and
perfectly distinct, are loosely connected together by a kind of spongy
substance, in texture somewhat resembling net-work, called the cellular
membrane; and the whole is covered by the skin.</p>

<p>The <i>skin</i>, as well as the bark of vegetables, is formed of
three coats. The external one is called the <i>cuticle</i> or
<i>epidermis</i>; the second, which is
<span class = "pagenum">311</span>
<a name = "page311" id = "page311"> </a>
called the <i>mucous membrane</i>, is of a thin soft texture, and
consists of a mucous substance, which in negroes is black, and is the
cause of their skin appearing of that colour.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is then the external skin of negroes white like ours?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but as the cuticle is transparent, as well as porous, the
blackness of the mucous membrane is visible through it. The extremities
of the nerves are spread over this skin, so that the sensation of
feeling is transmitted through the cuticle. The internal covering of the
muscles, which is properly the skin, is the thickest, the toughest, and
most resisting of the whole; it is this membrane which is so essential
in the arts, by forming leather when combined with tannin.</p>

<p>The skin which covers the animal body, as well as those membranes
that form the coats of the vessels, consists almost exclusively of
gelatine; and is capable of being converted into glue, size, or
jelly.</p>

<p>The cavities between the muscles and the skin are usually filled with
fat, which lodges in the cells of the membranous net before mentioned,
and gives to the external form (especially in the
<span class = "pagenum">312</span>
<a name = "page312" id = "page312"> </a>
human figure) that roundness, smoothness, and softness, so essential to
beauty.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And the skin itself is, I&nbsp;think, a very ornamental part of the
human frame, both from the fineness of its texture, and the variety and
delicacy of its tints.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This variety and harmonious graduation of colours, proceed, not so
much from the skin itself, as from the internal organs which transmit
their several colours through it, these being only softened and blended
by the colour of the skin, which is uniformly of a yellowish white.</p>

<p>Thus modified, the darkness of the veins appears of a pale blue
colour, and the floridness of the arteries is changed to a delicate
pink. In the most transparent parts, the skin exhibits the bloom of the
rose, whilst where it is more opake its own colour predominates; and at
the joints, where the bones are most prominent, their whiteness is often
discernible. In a word, every part of the human frame seems to
contribute to its external grace; and this not merely by producing a
pleasing variety of tints, but by a peculiar kind of beauty which
belongs to each individual part. Thus it is to the solidity and
arrangement of the bones that the human figure owes the grandeur of its
stature,
<span class = "pagenum">313</span>
<a name = "page313" id = "page313"> </a>
and its firm and dignified deportment. The muscles delineate the form,
and stamp it with energy and grace; and the soft substance which is
spread over them smooths their ruggedness, and gives to the contours the
gentle undulations of the line of beauty. Every organ of sense is a
peculiar and separate ornament; and the skin, which polishes the
surface, and gives it that charm of colouring so inimitable by art,
finally conspires to render the whole the fairest work of the
creation.</p>

<p>But now that we have seen in what manner the animal frame is formed,
let us observe how it provides for its support, and how the several
organs, which form so complete a whole, are nourished and
maintained.</p>

<p>This will lead us to a more particular explanation of the internal
organs: here we shall not meet with so much apparent beauty, because
these parts were not intended by nature to be exhibited to view; but the
beauty of design, in the internal organisation of the animal frame, is,
if possible, still more remarkable than that of the external parts.</p>

<p>We shall defer this subject till our next interview.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =

animal system is composed, and have formed some idea of the nature of
its organisation. In order to complete the subject, it remains for us to
examine in what manner it is nourished and supported.</p>

<p>Vegetables, we have observed, obtain their nourishment from various
substances, either in their elementary state, or in a very simple state
of combination; as carbon, water, and salts, which they pump up from the
soil; and carbonic acid and oxygen, which they absorb from the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Animals, on the contrary, feed on substances of the most complicated
kind; for they derive their sustenance, some from the animal creation,
others from the vegetable kingdom, and some from both.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">315</span>
<a name = "page315" id = "page315"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And there is one species of animals, which, not satisfied with
enjoying either kind of food in its simple state, has invented the art
of combining them together in a thousand ways, and of rendering even the
mineral kingdom subservient to its refinements.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Nor is this all; for our delicacies are collected from the various
climates of the earth, so that the four quarters of the globe are often
obliged to contribute to the preparation of our simplest dishes.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But the very complicated substances which constitute the nourishment
of animals, do not, I&nbsp;suppose, enter into their system in their
actual state of combination?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>So far from it, that they not only undergo a new arrangement of their
parts, but a selection is made of such as are most proper for the
nourishment of the body, and those only enter into the system, and are
animalised.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And by what organs is this process performed?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Chiefly by the stomach, which is the organ of
<span class = "pagenum">316</span>
<a name = "page316" id = "page316"> </a>
digestion, and the prime regulator of the animal frame.</p>

<p><i>Digestion</i> is the first step towards nutrition. It consists in
reducing into one homogeneous mass the various substances that are taken
as nourishment; it is performed by first chewing and mixing the solid
aliment with the saliva, which reduces it to a soft mass, in which state
it is conveyed into the stomach, where it is more completely dissolved
by the <i>gastric juice</i>.</p>

<p>This fluid (which is secreted into the stomach by appropriate glands)
is so powerful a solvent that scarcely any substances will resist its
action.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The coats of the stomach, however, cannot be attacked by it,
otherwise we should be in danger of having them destroyed when the
stomach was empty.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They are probably not subject to its action; as long, at least, as
life continues. But it appears, that when the gastric juice has no
foreign substance to act upon, it is capable of occasioning a degree of
irritation in the coats of the stomach, which produces the sensation of
hunger. The gastric juice, together with the heat and muscular action of
the stomach, converts the aliment into an uniform pulpy mass called
chyme. This passes
<span class = "pagenum">317</span>
<a name = "page317" id = "page317"> </a>
into the intestines, where it meets with the bile and some other fluids,
by the agency of which, and by the operation of other causes hitherto
unknown, the chyme is changed into chyle, a&nbsp;much thinner substance,
somewhat resembling milk, which is pumped by immense numbers of small
absorbent vessels spread over the internal surface of the intestines.
These, after many circumvolutions, gradually meet and unite into large
branches, till they at length collect the chyle into one vessel, which
pours its contents into the great vein near the heart, by which means
the food, thus prepared, enters into the circulation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But I do not yet clearly understand how the blood, thus formed,
nourishes the body and supplies all the secretions?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Before this can be explained to you, you must first allow me to
complete the formation of the blood. The chyle may, indeed, be
considered as forming the chief ingredient of blood; but this fluid is
not perfect until it has passed through the lungs, and undergone
(together with the blood that has already circulated) certain necessary
changes that are effected by <span class =

<p>I am very glad that you are going to explain the nature of
respiration: I&nbsp;have often longed to understand it, for though we
talk incessantly of <i>breathing</i>, I&nbsp;never knew precisely what
purpose it answered.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is indeed one of the most interesting processes imaginable; but,
in order to understand this function well, it will be necessary to enter
into some previous explanations. Tell me, Emily,&mdash;what do you
understand by respiration?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Respiration, I conceive, consists simply in alternately
<i>inspiring</i> air into the lungs, and <i>expiring</i> it from
them.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Your answer will do very well as a general definition. But, in order
to form a tolerably clear notion of the various phenomena of
respiration, there are many circumstances to be taken into
consideration.</p>

<p>In the first place, there are two things to be distinguished in
respiration, the <i>mechanical</i> and the <i>chemical</i> part of the
process.</p>

<p>The mechanism of breathing depends on the alternate expansions and
contractions of the chest, in which the lungs are contained. When the
<span class = "pagenum">319</span>
<a name = "page319" id = "page319"> </a>
chest dilates, the cavity is enlarged, and the air rushes in at the
mouth, to fill up the vacuum formed by this dilatation; when it
contracts, the cavity is diminished, and the air forced out again.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I thought that it was the lungs that contracted and expanded in
breathing?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They do likewise; but their action is only the consequence of that of
the chest. The lungs, together with the heart and largest blood vessels,
in a manner fill up the cavity of the chest; they could not, therefore,
dilate if the chest did not previously expand; and, on the other hand,
when the chest contracts, it compresses the lungs and forces the air out
of them.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The lungs, then, are like bellows, and the chest is the power that
works them.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Precisely so. Here is a curious little figure (<a class = "smallcaps"
href = "#plateXVb">Plate XV.</a> Fig.&nbsp;5.), that will assist me in
explaining the mechanism of breathing.</p>

body. By the chest, therefore, I&nbsp;mean that large cavity in the
upper part of the body contained within the ribs, the neck, and the
diaphragm; this membrane is muscular, and capable of contraction and
dilatation. The contraction may be imitated by drawing the bladder tight

<p>By letting the bladder loose again, we imitate the dilatation of the
diaphragm, and the cavity of the chest being enlarged, the lungs expand,
and the air rushes in to fill them.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This figure, I think, gives a very clear idea of the process of
breathing.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">321</span>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It illustrates tolerably well the action of the lungs and diaphragm;
but those are not the only powers that are concerned in enlarging or
diminishing the cavity of the chest; the ribs are also possessed of a
muscular motion for the same purpose; they are alternately drawn in,
edgeways, to assist the contraction, and stretched out, like the hoops
of a barrel, to contribute to the dilatation of the chest.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I always supposed that the elevation and depression of the ribs were
the consequence, not the cause of breathing.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is exactly the reverse. The muscular action of the <ins class =
"mycorr" title = "text reads ‘diaphram’">diaphragm</ins>, together with
that of the ribs, are the <i>causes</i> of the contraction and expansion
of the chest; and the air rushing into, and being expelled from the
lungs, are only <i>consequences</i> of those actions.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I confess that I thought the act of breathing began by opening the
mouth for the air to rush in, and that it was the air alone, which, by
alternately rushing in and out, occasioned the dilatations and
contractions of the lungs and chest.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">322</span>
<a name = "page322" id = "page322"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Try the experiment of merely opening your mouth; the air will not
rush in, till by an interior muscular action you produce a
vacuum&mdash;yes, just so, your diaphragm is now dilated, and the ribs
expanded. But you will not be able to keep them long in that state. Your
lungs and chest are already resuming their former state, and expelling
the air with which they had just been filled. This mechanism goes on
more or less rapidly, but, in general, a&nbsp;person at rest and in
health will breathe between fifteen and twenty-five times in a
minute.</p>

<p>We may now proceed to the chemical effects of respiration; but, for
this purpose, it is necessary that you should previously have some
notion of the <i>circulation</i> of the blood. Tell me, Caroline, what
do you understand by the circulation of the blood?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I am delighted that you come to that subject, for it is one that has
long excited my curiosity. But I cannot conceive how it is connected
with respiration. The idea I have of the circulation is, that the blood
runs from the heart through the veins all over the body, and back again
to the heart.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I could hardly have expected a better definition
<span class = "pagenum">323</span>
<a name = "page323" id = "page323"> </a>
from you; it is, however, not quite correct, for you do not distinguish
the <i>arteries</i> from the <i>veins</i>, which, as we have already
observed, are two distinct sets of vessels, each having its own peculiar
functions. The arteries convey the blood from the heart to the
extremities of the body; and the veins bring it back into the heart.</p>

<p>This sketch will give you an idea of the manner in which some of the
principal veins and arteries of the human body branch out of the heart,
which may be considered as a common centre to both sets of vessels. The
heart is a kind of strong elastic bag, or muscular cavity, which
possesses a power of dilating and contracting itself, for the purposes
of alternately receiving and expelling the blood, in order to carry on
the process of circulation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Why are the arteries in this drawing painted red, and the veins
purple?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is to point out the difference of the colour of the blood in these
two sets of vessels.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But if it is the same blood that flows from the arteries into the
veins, how can its colour be changed?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">324</span>
<a name = "page324" id = "page324"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This change arises from various circumstances. In the first place,
during its passage through the arteries, the blood undergoes a
considerable alteration, some of its constituent parts being gradually
separated from it for the purpose of nourishing the body, and of
supplying the various secretions. The consequence of this is, that the
florid arterial colour of the blood changes by degrees to a deep purple,
which is its constant colour in the veins. On the other hand, the blood
is recruited during its return through the veins by the fresh chyle, or
imperfect blood, which has been produced by food; and it receives also
lymph from the absorbent vessels, as we have before mentioned. In
consequence of these several changes, the blood returns to the heart in
a state very different from that in which it left it. It is loaded with
a greater proportion of hydrogen and carbon, and is no longer fit for
the nourishment of the body, or other purposes of circulation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And in this state does it mix in the heart with the pure florid blood
that runs into the arteries?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No. The heart is divided into two cavities or compartitions, called
the <i>right</i> and <i>left ventricles</i>.
<span class = "pagenum">325</span>
<a name = "page325" id = "page325"> </a>
The left ventricle is the receptacle for the pure arterial blood
previous to its circulation; whilst the venous, or impure blood, which
returns to the heart after having circulated, is received into the right
ventricle, previous to its purification, which I shall presently
explain.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>For my part, I always thought that the same blood circulated again
and again through the body, without undergoing any change.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yet you must have supposed that the blood circulated for some
purpose?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I knew that it was indispensable to life; but had no idea of its real
functions.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But now that you understand that the blood conveys nourishment to
every part of the body, and supplies the various secretions, you must be
sensible that it cannot constantly answer these objects without being
proportionally renovated and purified.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But does not the chyle answer this purpose?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">326</span>
<a name = "page326" id = "page326"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Only in part. It renovates the nutritive principles of the blood, but
does not relieve it from the superabundance of water and carbon with
which it is encumbered.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>How, then, is this effected?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By <span class = "smallroman">RESPIRATION</span>. This is one of the
grand mysteries which modern chemistry has disclosed. When the venous
blood enters the right ventricle of the heart, it contracts by its
muscular power, and throws the blood through a large vessel into the
lungs, which are contiguous, and through which it circulates by millions
of small ramifications. Here it comes in contact with the air which we
breathe. The action of the air on the blood in the lungs is, indeed,
concealed, from our immediate observation; but we are able to form a
tolerably accurate judgment of it from the changes which it effects not
only in the blood, but also on the air expired.</p>

<p>The air, after passing through the lungs, is found to contain all the
nitrogen inspired, but to have lost part of its oxygen, and to have
acquired a portion of watery vapour and of carbonic acid gas. Hence it
is inferred, that when the air comes
<span class = "pagenum">327</span>
<a name = "page327" id = "page327"> </a>
in contact with the venous blood in the lungs, the oxygen attracts from
it the superabundant quantity of carbon with which it has impregnated
itself during the circulation, and converts it into carbonic acid. This
gaseous acid, together with the redundant moisture from the lungs<a
class = "tag" name = "tag26" id = "tag26" href = "#note26">*</a>, being
then expired, the blood is restored to its former purity, that is, to
the state of arterial blood, and is thus again enabled to perform its
various functions.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This is truly wonderful! Of all that we have yet learned, I&nbsp;do
not recollect any thing that has appeared to me so curious and
interesting. I&nbsp;almost believe that I should like to study anatomy
now, though I have hitherto had so disgusting an idea of it. Pray, to
whom are we indebted for these beautiful discoveries?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Priestley and Crawford, in this country, and Lavoisier, in France,
are the principal inventors of the theory of respiration. Of late years
the subject has been farther illustrated and simplified by the accurate
experiments of Messrs. Allen and Pepys. But the still more important and
more
<span class = "pagenum">328</span>
<a name = "page328" id = "page328"> </a>
admirable discovery of the circulation of the blood was made long before
by our immortal countryman Harvey.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Indeed I never heard any thing that delighted me so much as this
theory of respiration. But I hope, Mrs.&nbsp;B., that you will enter a
little more into particulars before you dismiss so interesting a
subject. We left the blood in the lungs to undergo the salutary change:
but how does it thence spread to all the parts of the body?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>After circulating through the lungs, the blood is collected into four
large vessels, by which it is conveyed into the left ventricle of the
heart, whence it is propelled to all the different parts of the body by
a large artery, which gradually ramifies into millions of small arteries
through the whole frame. From the extremities of these little
ramifications the blood is transmitted to the veins, which bring it back
to the heart and lungs, to go round again and again in the manner we
have just described. You see, therefore, that the blood actually
undergoes two circulations; the one, through the lungs, by which it is
converted into pure arterial blood; the other, or general circulation,
by which nourishment is conveyed to every part of the
<span class = "pagenum">329</span>
<a name = "page329" id = "page329"> </a>
body; and these are both equally indispensable to the support of animal
life.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But whence proceeds the carbon with which the blood is impregnated
when it comes into the lungs?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Carbon exists in a greater proportion in blood than in organised
animal matter. The blood, therefore, after supplying its various
secretions, becomes loaded with an excess of carbon, which is carried
off by respiration; and the formation of new chyle from the food affords
a constant supply of carbonaceous matter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I wonder what quantity of carbon may be expelled from the blood by
respiration in the course of 24 hours?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It appears by the experiments of Messrs. Allen and Pepys that about
40,000 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas are emitted from the lungs of a
healthy person, daily; which is equivalent to <i>eleven ounces</i> of
solid carbon every 24 hours.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What an immense quantity! And pray how
<span class = "pagenum">330</span>
<a name = "page330" id = "page330"> </a>
much of carbonic acid gas do we expel from our lungs at each
expiration?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The quantity of air which we take into our lungs at each inspiration,
is about 40 cubic inches, which contain a little less than 10 cubic
inches of oxygen; and of those 10 inches, one-eighth is converted into
carbonic acid gas on passing once through the lungs<a class = "tag" name
= "tag27" id = "tag27" href = "#note27">*</a>, a&nbsp;change which is
sufficient to prevent air which has only been breathed once from
suffering a taper to burn in&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Pray, how does the air come in contact with the blood in the
lungs?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I cannot answer this question without entering into an explanation of
the nature and structure of the lungs. You recollect that the venous
blood, on being expelled from the right ventricle, enters the lungs to
go through what we may call the lesser circulation; the large trunk or
vessel that conveys it branches out, at its entrance into the lungs,
into an infinite number of very fine ramifications.
<span class = "pagenum">331</span>
<a name = "page331" id = "page331"> </a>
The windpipe, which conveys the air from the mouth into the lungs,
likewise spreads out into a corresponding number of air vessels, which
follow the same course as the blood vessels, forming millions of very
minute air-cells. These two sets of vessels are so interwoven as to form
a sort of net-work, connected into a kind of spongy mass, in which every
particle of blood must necessarily come in contact with a particle of
air.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But since the blood and the air are contained in different vessels,
how can they come into contact?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They act on each other through the membrane which forms the coats of
these vessels; for although this membrane prevents the blood and the air
from mixing together in the lungs, yet it is no impediment to their
chemical action on each other.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Are the lungs composed entirely of blood vessels and air vessels?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I believe they are, with the addition only of nerves and of a small
quantity of the cellular substance before mentioned, which connects the
whole into an uniform mass.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">332</span>
<a name = "page332" id = "page332"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray, why are the lungs always spoken of in the plural number? Are
there more than one?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; for though they form but one organ, they really consist of two
compartments called lobes, which are enclosed in separate membranes or
bags, each occupying one side of the chest, and being in close contact
with each other, but without communicating together. This is a beautiful
provision of nature, in consequence of which, if one of the lobes be
wounded, the other performs the whole process of respiration till the
first is healed.</p>

<p>The blood, thus completed, by the process of respiration, forms the
most complex of all animal compounds, since it contains not only the
numerous materials necessary to form the various secretions, as saliva,
tears, &amp;c. but likewise all those that are required to nourish the
several parts of the body, as the muscles, bones, nerves,
glands,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>There seems to be a singular analogy between the blood of animals and
the sap of vegetables; for each of these fluids contains the several
materials destined for the nutrition of the numerous class of bodies to
which they respectively belong.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">333</span>
<a name = "page333" id = "page333"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Nor is the production of these fluids in the animal and vegetable
systems entirely different; for the absorbent vessels, which pump up the
chyle from the stomach and intestines, may be compared to the absorbents
of the roots of plants, which suck up the nourishment from the soil. And
the analogy between the sap and the blood may be still further traced,
if we follow the latter in the course of its circulation; for, in the
living animal, we find every where organs which are possessed of a power
to secrete from the blood and appropriate to themselves the ingredients
requisite for their support.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But whence do these organs derive their respective powers?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>From a peculiar organisation, the secret of which no one has yet been
able to unfold. But it must be ultimately by means of the vital
principle that both their mechanical and chemical powers are brought
into action.</p>

<p>I cannot dismiss the subject of circulation without mentioning
<i>perspiration</i>, a&nbsp;secretion which is immediately connected
with it, and acts a most important part in the animal economy.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">334</span>
<a name = "page334" id = "page334"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is not this secretion likewise made by appropriate glands?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; it is performed by the extremities of the arteries, which
penetrate through the skin and terminate under the cuticle, through the
pores of which the perspiration issues. When this fluid is not secreted
in excess, it is <i>insensible</i>, because it is dissolved by the air
as it exudes from the pores; but when it is secreted faster than it can
be dissolved, it becomes <i>sensible</i>, as it assumes its liquid
state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This secretion bears a striking resemblance to the transpiration of
the sap of plants. They both consist of the most fluid part, and both
exude from the surface by the extremities of the vessels through which
they circulate.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And the analogy does not stop there; for, since it has been
ascertained that the sap returns into the roots of the plants, the
resemblance between the animal and vegetable circulation is become still
more obvious. The latter, however, is far from being complete, since, as
we observed before, it consists only in a rising and descending of
<span class = "pagenum">335</span>
<a name = "page335" id = "page335"> </a>
the sap, whilst in animals the blood actually <i>circulates</i> through
every part of the system.</p>

<p>We have now, I think, traced the process of nutrition, from the
introduction of the food into the stomach to its finally becoming a
constituent part of the animal frame. This will, therefore, be a fit
period to conclude our present conversation. What further remarks we
have to make on the animal economy shall be reserved for our next
interview.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =

thinking much of the theory of respiration; and I cannot help being
struck with the resemblance which it appears to bear to the process of
combustion. For in respiration, as in most cases of combustion, the air
suffers a change, and a portion of its oxygen combines with carbon,
producing carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I am much pleased that this idea has occurred to you: these two
processes appear so very analogous, that it has been supposed that a
kind of combustion actually takes place in the lungs; not
<span class = "pagenum">337</span>
<a name = "page337" id = "page337"> </a>
of the blood, but of the superfluous carbon which the oxygen attracts
from&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>A combustion in our lungs! that is a curious idea indeed! But,
Mrs.&nbsp;B., how can you call the action of the air on the blood in the
lungs combustion, when neither light nor heat are produced
by&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I was going to make the same objection.&mdash;Yet I do not conceive
how the oxygen can combine with the carbon, and produce carbonic acid,
without disengaging heat?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The fact is, that heat is disengaged.<a class = "tag" name = "tag28"
id = "tag28" href = "#note28">*</a> Whether any light be evolved,
I&nbsp;cannot pretend to determine; but that heat is produced in

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>How wonderful! that the very process which purifies and elaborates

<span class = "pagenum">338</span>
<a name = "page338" id = "page338"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This is the theory of animal heat in its original simplicity, such
nearly as it was first proposed by Black and Lavoisier. It was equally
clear and ingenious; and was at first generally adopted. But it was
objected, on second consideration, that if the whole of the animal heat
was evolved in the lungs, it would necessarily be much less in the
extremities of the body than immediately at its source; which is not
found to be the case. This objection, however, which was by no means
frivolous, is now satisfactorily removed by the following
consideration:&mdash;Venous blood has been found by experiment to have
<i>less capacity for heat</i> than arterial blood; whence it follows
that the blood, in gradually passing from the arterial to the venous
state, during the circulation, parts with a portion of caloric, by means
of which heat is diffused through every part of the body.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>More and more admirable!</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The cause of animal heat was always a perfect mystery to me, and I am
delighted with its explanation.&mdash;But pray, Mrs.&nbsp;B., can you
tell me what is the reason of the increase of heat that takes place in a
fever?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">339</span>
<a name = "page339" id = "page339"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is it not because we then breathe quicker, and therefore more heat is
disengaged in the system?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That may be one reason: but I should think that the principal cause
of the heat experienced in fevers, is, that there is no vent for the
caloric which is generated in the body. One of the most considerable
secretions is the insensible perspiration; this is constantly carrying
off caloric in a latent state; but during the hot stage of a fever, the
pores are so contracted, that all perspiration ceases, and the
accumulation of caloric in the body occasions those burning sensations
which are so painful.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This is, no doubt, the reason why the perspiration that often
succeeds the hot stage of a fever affords so much relief. If I had known
this theory of animal heat when I had a fever last summer, I&nbsp;think
I should have found some amusement in watching the chemical processes
that were going on within&nbsp;me.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But exercise likewise produces animal heat, and that must be quite in
a different manner.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">340</span>
<a name = "page340" id = "page340"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not so much so as you think; for the more exercise you take, the more
the body is stimulated, and requires recruiting. For this purpose the
circulation of the blood is quickened, the breath proportionably
accelerated, and consequently a greater quantity of caloric evolved.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>True; after running very fast, I gasp for breath, my respiration is
quick and hard, and it is just then that I begin to feel hot.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It would seem, then, that violent exercise should produce fever.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not if the person is in a good state of health; for the additional
caloric is then carried off by the perspiration which succeeds.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What admirable resources nature has provided for us! By the
production of animal heat she has enabled us to keep up the temperature
of our bodies above that of inanimate objects; and whenever this source
becomes too abundant, the excess is carried off by perspiration.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">341</span>
<a name = "page341" id = "page341"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is by the same law of nature that we are enabled, in all climates,
and in all seasons, to preserve our bodies of an equal temperature, or
at least very nearly&nbsp;so.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>You cannot mean to say that our bodies are of the same temperature in
summer, and in winter, in England, and in the West-Indies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, I do; at least if you speak of the temperature of the blood, and
the internal parts of the body; for those parts that are immediately in
contact with the atmosphere, such as the hands and face, will
occasionally get warmer, or colder, than the internal or more sheltered
parts. But if you put the bulb of a thermometer in your mouth, which is
the best way of ascertaining the real temperature of your body, you will
scarcely perceive any difference in its indication, whatever may be the
difference of temperature of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And when I feel overcome by heat, I am really not hotter than when I

body is certainly a little warmer than when he feels very cold; but this
difference is much smaller than our sensations would make us believe;
and the natural standard is soon restored by rest and by perspiration.
It is chiefly the external parts that are warmer, and I am sure that you
will be surprised to hear that the internal temperature of the body
scarcely ever descends below ninety-five or ninety-six degrees, and
seldom attains one hundred and four or one hundred and five degrees,
even in the most violent fevers.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The greater quantity of caloric, therefore, that we receive from the
atmosphere in summer, cannot raise the temperature of our bodies beyond
certain limits, as it does that of inanimate bodies, because an excess
of caloric is carried off by perspiration.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But the temperature of the atmosphere, and consequently that of
inanimate bodies, is surely never so high as that of animal heat?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">343</span>
<a name = "page343" id = "page343"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon. Frequently in the East and West Indies, and
sometimes in the southern parts of Europe, the atmosphere is above
ninety-eight degrees, which is the common temperature of animal heat.
Indeed, even in this country, it occasionally happens that the sun’s
rays, setting full on an object, elevate its temperature above that
point.</p>

<p>In illustration of the power which our bodies have to resist the
effects of external heat, Sir Charles Blagden, with some other
gentlemen, made several very curious experiments. He remained for some
time in an oven heated to a temperature not much inferior to that of
boiling water, without suffering any other inconvenience than a profuse
perspiration, which he supported by drinking plentifully.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>He could scarcely consider the perspiration as an inconvenience,
since it saved him from being baked by giving vent to the excess of
caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I always thought, I confess, that it was from the heat of the
perspiration that we suffered in summer.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">344</span>
<a name = "page344" id = "page344"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You now find that you are quite mistaken. Whenever evaporation takes
place, cold, you know, is produced in consequence of a quantity of
caloric being carried off in a latent state; this is the case with
perspiration, and it is in this way that it affords relief. It is on
that account also that we are so apt to <i>catch cold</i>, when in a
state of profuse perspiration. It is for the same reason that tea is
often refreshing in summer, though it appears to heat you at the moment
you drink&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And in winter, on the contrary, tea is pleasant on account of its
heat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; for we have then rather to guard against a deficiency than an
excess of caloric, and you do not find that tea will excite perspiration
in winter, unless after dancing, or any other violent exercise.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What is the reason that it is dangerous to eat ice after dancing, or
to drink any thing cold when one is very hot?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">345</span>
<a name = "page345" id = "page345"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because the loss of heat arising from the perspiration, conjointly
with the chill occasioned by the cold draught, produce more cold than
can be borne with safety, unless you continue to use the same exercise
after drinking that you did before; for the heat occasioned by the
exercise will counteract the effects of the cold drink, and the danger
will be removed. You may, however, contrary to the common notion,
consider it as a rule, that cold liquids may, at all times, be drunk
with perfect safety, however hot you may feel, provided you are not at
the moment in a state of great perspiration, and on condition that you
keep yourself in gentle exercise afterwards.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But since we are furnished with such resources against the extremes
of heat or cold, I&nbsp;should have thought that all climates would have
been equally wholesome.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is true, in a certain degree, with regard to those who have been
accustomed to them from birth; for we find that the natives of those
climates, which we consider as most deleterious, are as healthy as
ourselves; and if such climates are unwholesome to those who are
habituated to a
<span class = "pagenum">346</span>
<a name = "page346" id = "page346"> </a>
more moderate temperature, it is because the animal economy does not
easily accustom itself to considerable changes.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But pray, Mrs. B., if the circulation preserves the body of an
uniform temperature, how does it happen that animals are sometimes
frozen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because, if more heat be carried off by the atmosphere than the
circulation can supply, the cold will finally prevail, the heart will
cease to beat, and the animal will be frozen. And, likewise, if the body
remained long exposed to a degree of heat, greater than the perspiration
could carry off, it would at last lose the power of resisting its
destructive influence.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Fish, I suppose, have no animal heat, but only partake of the
temperature of the water in which they live?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And their coldness, no doubt, proceeds from their not breathing?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>All kinds of fish breathe more or less, though
<span class = "pagenum">347</span>
<a name = "page347" id = "page347"> </a>
in a much smaller degree than land animals. Nor are they entirely
destitute of animal heat, though, for the same reason, they are much
colder than other creatures. They have comparatively but a very small
quantity of blood, therefore but very little oxygen is required, and a
proportionally small quantity of animal heat is generated.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But how can fish breathe under water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They breathe by means of the air which is dissolved in the water, and
if you put them into water deprived of air by boiling, they are soon
suffocated.</p>

<p>If a fish is confined in a vessel of water closed from the air, it
soon dies; and any fish put in afterwards would be killed immediately,
as all the air had been <ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads
‘previouly’">previously</ins> consumed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Are there any species of animals that breathe more than
we&nbsp;do?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; birds, of all animals, breathe the greatest quantity of air in
proportion to their size; and it
<span class = "pagenum">348</span>
<a name = "page348" id = "page348"> </a>
is to this that they are supposed to owe the peculiar firmness and
strength of their muscles, by which they are enabled to support the
violent exertion of flying.</p>

<p>This difference between birds and fish, which may be considered as
the two extremes of the scale of muscular strength, is well worth
observing. Birds residing constantly in the atmosphere, surrounded by
oxygen, and respiring it in greater proportions than any other species
of animals, are endowed with a superior degree of muscular strength,
whilst the muscles of fish, on the contrary, are flaccid and oily; these
animals are comparatively feeble in their motions, and their temperature
is scarcely above that of the water in which they live. This is, in all
probability, owing to their imperfect respiration; the quantity of
hydrogen and carbon, that is in consequence accumulated in their bodies,
forms the oil which is so strongly characteristic of that species of
animals, and which relaxes and softens the small quantity of fibrine
which their muscles contain.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But, Mrs. B., there are some species of birds that frequent both
elements, as, for instance, ducks and other water fowl. Of what nature
is the flesh of these?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">349</span>
<a name = "page349" id = "page349"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Such birds, in general, make but little use of their wings; if they
fly, it is but feebly, and only to a short distance. Their flesh, too,
partakes of the oily nature, and even in taste sometimes resembles that
of fish. This is the case not only with the various kinds of water
fowls, but with all other amphibious animals, as the otter, the
crocodile, the lizard,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And what is the reason that reptiles are so deficient in muscular
strength?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is because they usually live under ground, and seldom come into
the atmosphere. They have imperfect, and sometimes no discernible organs
of respiration; they partake therefore of the soft oily nature of fish;
indeed, many of them are amphibious, as frogs, toads, and snakes, and
very few of them find any difficulty in remaining a length of time under
water. Whilst, on the contrary, the insect tribe, that are so strong in
proportion to their size, and alert in their motions, partake of the
nature of birds, air being their peculiar element, and their organs of
respiration being comparatively larger than in other classes of
animals.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">350</span>
<a name = "page350" id = "page350"> </a>
<p>I have now given you a short account of the principal animal
functions. However interesting the subject may appear to you,
a&nbsp;fuller investigation of it would, I&nbsp;fear, lead us too far
from our object.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yet I shall not quit it without much regret; for of all the branches
of chemistry, it is certainly the most curious and most interesting.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But, Mrs.&nbsp;B., I must remind you that you promised to give us
some account of the nature of <i>milk</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>True. There are several other animal productions that deserve
likewise to be mentioned. We shall begin with milk, which is certainly
the most important and the most interesting of all the animal
secretions.</p>

<p>Milk, like all other animal substances, ultimately yields by analysis
oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen. These are combined in it under
the forms of albumen, gelatine, oil, and water. But milk contains,
besides, a&nbsp;considerable portion of phosphat of lime, the purposes
of which I have already pointed out.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">351</span>
<a name = "page351" id = "page351"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes; it is this salt which serves to nourish the tender bones of the
suckling.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>To reduce milk to its elements, would be a very complicated, as well
as useless operation; but this fluid, without any chemical assistance,
may be decomposed into three parts, <i>cream</i>, <i>curds</i>, and
<i>whey</i>. These constituents of milk have but a very slight affinity
for each other, and you find accordingly that cream separates from milk
by mere standing. It consists chiefly of oil, which being lighter than
the other parts of the milk, gradually rises to the surface. It is of
this, you know, that butter is made, which is nothing more than
oxygenated cream.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Butter, then, is somewhat analogous to the waxy substance formed by
the oxygenation of vegetable oils.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very much so.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But is the cream oxygenated by churning?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Its oxygenation commences previous to churning,
<span class = "pagenum">352</span>
<a name = "page352" id = "page352"> </a>
merely by standing exposed to the atmosphere, from which it absorbs
oxygen. The process is afterwards completed by churning; the violent
motion which this operation occasions brings every particle of cream in
contact with the atmosphere, and thus facilitates its oxygenation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But the effect of churning, I have often observed in the dairy, is to
separate the cream into two substances, butter and butter-milk.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is to say, in proportion as the oily particles of the cream
become oxygenated, they separate from the other constituent parts of the
cream in the form of butter. So by churning you produce, on the one
hand, butter, or oxygenated oil; and, on the other, butter-milk, or
cream deprived of oil. But if you make butter by churning new milk
instead of cream, the butter-milk will then be exactly similar in its
properties to creamed or skimmed milk.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yet butter-milk is very different from common skimmed milk.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because you know it is customary, in order to
<span class = "pagenum">353</span>
<a name = "page353" id = "page353"> </a>
save time and labour, to make butter from cream alone. In this case,
therefore, the butter-milk is deprived of the creamed milk, which
contains both the curd and whey. Besides, in consequence of the milk
remaining exposed to the atmosphere during the separation of the cream,
the latter becomes more or less acid, as well as the butter-milk which
it yields in churning.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Why should not the butter be equally acidified by oxygenation?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Animal oil is not so easily acidified as the other ingredients of
milk. Butter, therefore, though usually made of sour cream, is not sour
itself, because the oily part of the cream had not been acidified.
Butter, however, is susceptible of becoming acid by an excess of oxygen;
it is then said to be rancid, and produces the sebacic acid, the same as
that which is obtained from fat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>If that be the case, might not rancid butter be sweetened by mixing
with it some substance that would take the acid from&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This idea has been suggested by Sir H. Davy,
<span class = "pagenum">354</span>
<a name = "page354" id = "page354"> </a>
who supposes, that if rancid butter were well washed in an alkaline
solution, the alkali would separate the acid from the butter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>You said just now that creamed milk consisted of curd and whey. Pray
how are these separated?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They may be separated by standing for a certain length of time
exposed to the atmosphere; but this decomposition may be almost
instantaneously effected by the chemical agency of a variety of
substances. Alkalies, rennet<a class = "tag" name = "tag29" id = "tag29"
href = "#note29">*</a>, and indeed almost all animal substances,
decompose milk by combining with the curds.</p>

<p>Acids and spirituous liquors, on the other hand, produce a
decomposition by combining with the whey. In order, therefore, to obtain
the whey pure, rennet, or alkaline substances, must be used to attract
the curds from&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>But if it be wished to obtain the curds pure, the whey must be
separated by acids, wine, or other spirituous liquors.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">355</span>
<a name = "page355" id = "page355"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This is a very useful piece of information; for I find white-wine
whey, which I sometimes take when I have a cold, extremely heating; now,
if the whey were separated by means of an alkali instead of wine, it
would not produce that effect.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Perhaps not. But I would strenuously advise you not to place too much
reliance on your slight chemical knowledge in medical matters. I&nbsp;do
not know why whey is not separated from curd by rennet, or by an alkali,
for the purpose which you mention; but I strongly suspect that there
must be some good reason why the preparation by means of wine is
generally preferred. I&nbsp;can, however, safely point out to you a
method of obtaining whey without either alkali, rennet, or wine; it is
by substituting lemon juice, a&nbsp;very small quantity of which will
separate it from the curds.</p>

<p>Whey, as an article of diet, is very wholesome, being remarkable
light of digestion. But its effect, taken medicinally, is chiefly,
I&nbsp;believe, to excite perspiration, by being drunk warm on going to
bed.</p>

<p>From whey a substance may be obtained in crystals by evaporation,
called <i>sugar of milk</i>. This substance is sweet to the taste, and
in its composition is so analogous to common sugar,
<span class = "pagenum">356</span>
<a name = "page356" id = "page356"> </a>
that it is susceptible of undergoing the vinous fermentation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Why then is not wine, or alcohol, made from whey?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The quantity of sugar contained in milk is so trifling, that it can
hardly answer that purpose. I&nbsp;have heard of only one instance of
its being used for the production of a spirituous liquor, and this is by
the <ins class = "correction" title = "error for ‘Tartar’?">Tartan</ins>
Arabs; their abundance of horses, as well as their scarcity of fruits,
has introduced the fermentation of mares’ milk, by which they produce a
liquor called <i>koumiss</i>. Whey is likewise susceptible of being
acidified by combining with oxygen from the atmosphere. It then produces
the <i>lactic acid</i>, which you may recollect is mentioned amongst the
animal acids, as the acid of milk.</p>

<p>Let us now see what are the properties of curds.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I know that they are made into cheese; but I have heard that for that
purpose they are separated from the whey by rennet, and yet this you
have just told us is not the method of obtaining pure curds?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Nor are pure curds so well adapted for the formation
<span class = "pagenum">357</span>
<a name = "page357" id = "page357"> </a>
of cheese. For the nature and flavour of the cheese depend, in a great
measure, upon the cream or oily matter which is left in the curds; so
that if every particle of cream be removed from the curds, the cheese is
scarcely eatable. Rich cheeses, such as cream and Stilton cheeses,
derive their excellence from the quantity, as well as the quality, of
the cream that enters into their composition.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I had no idea that milk was such an interesting compound. In many
respects there appears to me to be a very striking analogy between milk
and the contents of an egg, both in respect to their nature and their
use. They are, each of them, composed of the various substances
necessary for the nourishment of the young animal, and equally destined
for that purpose.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There is, however, a very essential difference. The young animal is
formed, as well as nourished, by the contents of the egg-shell; whilst
milk serves as nutriment to the suckling, only after it is born.</p>


<p class = "space">
There are several peculiar animal substances which do not enter into the
general enumeration of animal compounds, and which, however, deserve to
be mentioned.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">358</span>
<a name = "page358" id = "page358"> </a>
<p><i>Spermaceti</i> is of this class; it is a kind of oily substance
obtained from the head of the whale, which, however, must undergo a
certain preparation before it is in a fit state to be made into candles.
It is not much more combustible than tallow, but it is pleasanter to
burn, as it is less fusible and less greasy.</p>

<p><i>Ambergris</i> is another peculiar substance derived from a species
of whale. It is, however, seldom obtained from the animal itself, but is
generally found floating on the surface of the sea.</p>

<p><i>Wax</i>, you know, is a concrete oil, the peculiar product of the
bee, part of the constituents of which may probably be derived from
flowers, but so prepared by the organs of the bee, and so mixed with its
own substance, as to be decidedly an animal product. Bees’ wax is
naturally of a yellow colour, but it is bleached by long exposure to the
atmosphere, or may be instantaneously whitened by the oxy-muriatic acid.
The combustion of wax is far more perfect than that of tallow, and
consequently produces a greater quantity of light and heat.</p>

<p><i>Lac</i> is a substance very similar to wax in the manner of its
formation; it is the product of an insect, which collects its
ingredients from flowers, apparently for the purpose of protecting its
eggs from injury. It is formed into cells, fabricated with as much skill
as those of the honey-comb,
<span class = "pagenum">359</span>
<a name = "page359" id = "page359"> </a>
but differently arranged. The principal use of lac is in the manufacture
of sealing-wax, and in making varnishes and lacquers.</p>

<p><i>Musk</i>, <i>civet</i>, and <i>castor</i>, are other particular
productions, from different species of quadrupeds. The two first are
very powerful perfumes; the latter has a nauseous smell and taste, and
is only used medicinally.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is it from this substance that castor oil is obtained?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No. Far from it, for castor oil is a vegetable oil, expressed from
the seeds of a particular plant; and has not the least resemblance to
the medicinal substance obtained from the castor.</p>

<p><i>Silk</i> is a peculiar secretion of the silk-worm, with which it
builds its nest or cocoon. This insect was originally brought to Europe
from China. Silk, in its chemical nature, is very similar to the hair
and wool of animals; whilst in the insect it is a fluid, which is
coagulated, apparently by uniting with oxygen, as soon as it comes in
contact with the air. The moth of the silk-worm ejects a liquor which
appears to contain a particular acid, called <i>bombic</i>, the
properties of which are but very little known.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">360</span>
<a name = "page360" id = "page360"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Before we conclude the subject of the animal economy, shall we not
learn by what steps dead animals return to their elementary state?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Animal matter, although the most complicated of all natural
substances, returns to its elementary state by one single spontaneous
process, the <i>putrid fermentation</i>. By this, the albumen, fibrine,
&amp;c. are slowly reduced to the state of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen,
and carbon; and thus the circle of changes through which these
principles have passed is finally completed. They first quitted their
elementary form, or their combination with unorganised matter, to enter
into the vegetable system. Hence they were transmitted to the animal
kingdom; and from this they return, again to their primitive simplicity,
soon to re-enter the sphere of organised existence.</p>

<p>When all the circumstances necessary to produce fermentation do not
take place, animal, like vegetable matter, is liable to a partial or
imperfect decomposition, which converts it into a combustible substance
very like spermaceti. I&nbsp;dare say that Caroline, who is so fond of
analogies, will consider this as a kind of animal bitumen.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">361</span>
<a name = "page361" id = "page361"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And why should I not, since the processes which produce these
substances are so similar?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There is, however, one considerable difference; the state of bitumen
seems permanent, whilst that of animal substances, thus imperfectly
decomposed, is only transient; and unless precautions be taken to
preserve them in that state, a&nbsp;total dissolution infallibly ensues.
This circumstance, of the occasional conversion of animal matter into a
kind of spermaceti, is of late discovery. A&nbsp;manufacture has in
consequence been established near Bristol, in which, by exposing the
carcases of horses and other animals for a length of time under water,
the muscular parts are converted into this spermaceti-like substance.
The bones afterwards undergo a different process to produce hartshorn,
or, more properly, ammonia, and phosphorus; and the skin is prepared for
leather.</p>

<p>Thus art contrives to enlarge the sphere of useful purposes, for
which the elements were intended by nature; and the productions of the
several kingdoms are frequently arrested in their course, and variously
modified, by human skill, which compels them to contribute, under new
forms, to the necessities or luxuries of man.</p>

<p>But all that we enjoy, whether produced by the
<span class = "pagenum">362</span>
<a name = "page362" id = "page362"> </a>
spontaneous operations of nature, or the ingenious efforts of art,
proceed alike from the goodness of Providence.&mdash;To <span class =
"smallcaps">God</span> alone man owes the admirable faculties which
enable him to improve and modify the productions of nature, no less than
those productions themselves. In contemplating the works of the

from which they proceed; and thus every acquisition of knowledge will
