<p><span class = "firstletter">A</span>S you have now acquired some
elementary notions of <span class = "smallcaps">Natural
Philosophy</span>, I&nbsp;am going to propose to you another branch of
science, to which I am particularly anxious that you should devote a
share of your attention. This is <span class =
"smallcaps">Chemistry</span>, which is so closely connected with Natural
Philosophy, that the study of the one must be incomplete without some
knowledge of the other; for, it is obvious that we can derive but a very
imperfect idea of bodies from the study of the general laws by which
they are governed, if we remain totally ignorant of their intimate
nature.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<a name = "page2" id = "page2"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>To confess the truth, Mrs.&nbsp;B., I am not disposed to form a very
favourable idea of chemistry, nor do I expect to derive much
entertainment from it. I&nbsp;prefer the sciences which exhibit nature
on a grand scale, to those that are confined to the minutiæ of petty
details. Can the studies which we have lately pursued, the general
properties of matter, or the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, be
compared to the mixing up of a few insignificant drugs? I&nbsp;grant,
however, there may be entertaining experiments in chemistry, and should
not dislike to try some of them: the distilling, for instance, of
lavender, or rose water&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I rather imagine, my dear Caroline, that your want of taste for
chemistry proceeds from the very limited idea you entertain of its
object. You confine the chemist’s laboratory to the narrow precincts of
the apothecary’s and perfumer’s shops, whilst it is subservient to an
immense variety of other useful purposes. Besides, my dear, chemistry is
by no means confined to works of art. Nature also has her laboratory,
which is the universe, and there she is incessantly employed in chemical
operations. You are surprised, Caroline, but I assure you that the most
wonderful and the most interesting phenomena of nature are
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<a name = "page3" id = "page3"> </a>
almost all of them produced by chemical powers. What Bergman, in the
introduction to his history of chemistry, has said of this science, will
give you a more just and enlarged idea of it. The knowledge of nature
may be divided, he observes, into three periods. The first was that in
which the attention of men was occupied in learning the external forms
and characters of objects, and this is called <i>Natural History</i>. In
the second, they considered the effects of bodies acting on each other
by their mechanical power, as their weight and motion, and this
constitutes the science of <i>Natural Philosophy</i>. The third period
is that in which the properties and mutual action of the elementary
parts of bodies was investigated. This last is the science of <span
class = "smallcaps">Chemistry</span>, and I have no doubt you will soon
agree with me in thinking it the most interesting.</p>

<p>You may easily conceive, therefore, that without entering into the
minute details of practical chemistry, a&nbsp;woman may obtain such a
knowledge of the science as will not only throw an interest on the
common occurrences of life, but will enlarge the sphere of her ideas,
and render the contemplation of nature a source of delightful
instruction.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>If this is the case, I have certainly been much
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<a name = "page4" id = "page4"> </a>
mistaken in the notion I had formed of chemistry. I&nbsp;own that I
thought it was chiefly confined to the knowledge and preparation of
medicines.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is only a branch of chemistry which is called Pharmacy; and,
though the study of it is certainly of great importance to the world at
large, it belongs exclusively to professional men, and is therefore the
last that I should advise you to pursue.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But, did not the chemists formerly employ themselves in search of the
philosopher’s stone, or the secret of making gold?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>These were a particular set of misguided philosophers, who dignified
themselves with the name of Alchemists, to distinguish their pursuits
from those of the common chemists, whose studies were confined to the
knowledge of medicines.</p>

<p>But, since that period, chemistry has undergone so complete a
revolution, that, from an obscure and mysterious art, it is now become a
regular and beautiful science, to which art is entirely subservient. It
is true, however, that we are indebted to the alchemists for many very
useful discoveries, which sprung from their fruitless attempts
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<a name = "page5" id = "page5"> </a>
to make gold, and which, undoubtedly, have proved of infinitely greater
advantage to mankind than all their chimerical pursuits.</p>

<p>The modern chemists, instead of directing their ambition to the vain
attempt of producing any of the original substances in nature, rather
aim at analysing and imitating her operations, and have sometimes
succeeded in forming combinations, or effecting decompositions, no
instances of which occur in the chemistry of Nature. They have little
reason to regret their inability to make gold, whilst, by their
innumerable inventions and discoveries, they have so greatly stimulated
industry and facilitated labour, as prodigiously to increase the
luxuries as well as the necessaries of life.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But, I do not understand by what means chemistry can facilitate
labour; is not that rather the province of the mechanic?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There are many ways by which labour may be rendered more easy,
independently of mechanics; but even the machine, the most wonderful in
its effects, the Steam-engine, cannot be understood without the
assistance of chemistry. In agriculture, a&nbsp;chemical knowledge of
the nature of soils, and of vegetation, is highly useful; and, in those
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<a name = "page6" id = "page6"> </a>
arts which relate to the comforts and conveniences of life, it would be
endless to enumerate the advantages which result from the study of this
science.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But, pray, tell us more precisely in what manner the discoveries of
chemists have proved so beneficial to society?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That would be an injudicious anticipation; for you would not
comprehend the nature of such discoveries and useful applications, as
well as you will do hereafter. Without a due regard to method, we cannot
expect to make any progress in chemistry. I&nbsp;wish to direct your
observations chiefly to the chemical operations of Nature; but those of
Art are certainly of too high importance to pass unnoticed. We shall
therefore allow them also some share of our attention.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Well, then, let us now set to work regularly. I&nbsp;am very anxious
to begin.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The object of chemistry is to obtain a knowledge of the intimate
nature of bodies, and of their mutual action on each other. You find
therefore,
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<a name = "page7" id = "page7"> </a>
Caroline, that this is no narrow or confined science, which comprehends
every thing material within our sphere.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it must be inexhaustible; and I am a loss to
conceive how any proficiency can be made in a science whose objects are
so numerous.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>If every individual substance were formed of different materials, the
study of chemistry would, indeed, be endless; but you must observe that
the various bodies in nature are composed of certain elementary
principles, which are not very numerous.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes; I know that all bodies are composed of fire, air, earth, and
water; I&nbsp;learnt that many years ago.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But you must now endeavour to forget it. I&nbsp;have already informed
you what a great change chemistry has undergone since it has become a
regular science. Within these thirty years especially, it has
experienced an entire revolution, and it is now proved, that neither
fire, air, earth, nor water, can be called elementary bodies. For an
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<a name = "page8" id = "page8"> </a>
elementary body is one that has never been decomposed, that is to say,
separated into other substances; and fire, air, earth, and water, are
all of them susceptible of decomposition.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I thought that decomposing a body was dividing it into its minutest
parts. And if so, I&nbsp;do not understand why an elementary substance
is not capable of being decomposed, as well as any other.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You have misconceived the idea of <i>decomposition</i>; it is very
different from mere <i>division</i>. The latter simply reduces a body
into parts, but the former separates it into the various ingredients, or
materials, of which it is composed. If we were to take a loaf of bread,
and separate the several ingredients of which it is made, the flour, the
yeast, the salt, and the water, it would be very different from cutting
or crumbling the loaf into pieces.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I understand you now very well. To decompose a body is to separate
from each other the various elementary substances of which it
consists.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But flour, water, and other materials of bread,
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<a name = "page9" id = "page9"> </a>
according to our definition, are not elementary substances?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No, my dear; I mentioned bread rather as a familiar comparison, to
illustrate the idea, than as an example.</p>

<p>The elementary substances of which a body is composed are called the
<i>constituent</i> parts of that body; in decomposing it, therefore, we
separate its constituent parts. If, on the contrary, we divide a body by
chopping it to pieces, or even by grinding or pounding it to the finest
powder, each of these small particles will still consist of a portion of
the several constituent parts of the whole body: these are called the
<i>integrant</i> parts; do you understand the difference?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes, I think, perfectly. We <i>decompose</i> a body into its
<i>constituent</i> parts; and <i>divide</i> it into its <i>integrant</i>
parts.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Exactly so. If therefore a body consists of only one kind of
substance, though it may be divided into its integrant parts, it is not
possible to decompose it. Such bodies are therefore called <i>simple</i>
or <i>elementary</i>, as they are the elements of which all other bodies
are composed. <i>Compound
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<a name = "page10" id = "page10"> </a>
bodies</i> are such as consist of more than one of these elementary
principles.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But do not fire, air, earth, and water, consist, each of them, but of
one kind of substance?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No, my dear; they are every one of them susceptible of being
separated into various simple bodies. Instead of four, chemists now
reckon upwards of forty elementary substances. The existence of most of
these is established by the clearest experiments; but, in regard to a
few of them, particularly the most subtle agents of nature, <i>heat</i>,
<i>light</i>, and <i>electricity</i>, there is yet much uncertainty, and
I can only give you the opinion which seems most probably deduced from
the latest discoveries. After I have given you a list of the elementary
bodies, classed according to their properties, we shall proceed to
examine each of them separately, and then consider them in their
combinations with each other.</p>

<p>Excepting the more general agents of nature, heat, light, and
electricity, it would seem that the simple form of bodies is that of a
metal.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>You astonish me! I thought the metals were only
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<a name = "page11" id = "page11"> </a>
one class of minerals, and that there were besides, earths, stones,
rocks, acids, alkalies, vapours, fluids, and the whole of the animal and
vegetable kingdoms.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You have made a tolerably good enumeration, though I fear not
arranged in the most scientific order. All these bodies, however, it is
now strongly believed, may be ultimately resolved into metallic
substances. Your surprise at this circumstance is not singular, as the
decomposition of some of them, which has been but lately accomplished,
has excited the wonder of the whole philosophical world.</p>

<p>But to return to the list of simple bodies&mdash;these being usually
found in combination with oxygen, I&nbsp;shall class them according to
their properties when so combined. This will, I&nbsp;think, facilitate
their future investigation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray what is oxygen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>A simple body; at least one that is supposed to be so, as it has
never been decomposed. It is always found united with the negative
electricity. It will be one of the first of the elementary bodies whose
properties I shall explain to you, and, as
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<a name = "page12" id = "page12"> </a>
you will soon perceive, it is one of the most important in nature; but
it would be irrelevant to enter upon this subject at present. We must
now confine our attention to the enumeration and classification of the
simple bodies in general. They may be arranged as follows:</p>

<h5>CLASS I.</h5>

<p class = "listhead">

<p>Oh, what a formidable list! You will have much to do to explain it,
Mrs.&nbsp;B.; for I assure you it is perfectly unintelligible to me, and
I think rather perplexes than assists&nbsp;me.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Do not let that alarm you, my dear; I hope that hereafter this
classification will appear quite clear, and, so far from perplexing you,
will assist you in arranging your ideas. It would be in vain to attempt
forming a division that would appear perfectly clear to a beginner: for
you may easily conceive that a chemical division being necessarily
founded on properties with which you are almost wholly unacquainted, it
is impossible that you should at once be able to understand its meaning
or appreciate its utility.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<a name = "page16" id = "page16"> </a>
<p>But, before we proceed further, it will be necessary to give you some
idea of chemical attraction, a&nbsp;power on which the whole science
depends.</p>

<p><i>Chemical Attraction</i>, or the <i>Attraction of Composition</i>,
consists in the peculiar tendency which bodies of a different nature
have to unite with each other. It is by this force that all the
compositions, and decompositions, are effected.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What is the difference between chemical attraction, and the
attraction of cohesion, or of aggregation, which you often mentioned to
us, in former conversations?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The attraction of cohesion exists only between particles of the
<i>same</i> nature, whether simple or compound; thus it unites the
particles of a piece of metal which is a simple substance, and likewise
the particles of a loaf of bread which is a compound. The attraction of
composition, on the contrary, unites and maintains, in a state of
combination, particles of a <i>dissimilar</i> nature; it is this power
that forms each of the compound particles of which bread consists; and
it is by the attraction of cohesion that all these particles are
connected into a single mass.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<a name = "page17" id = "page17"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The attraction of cohesion, then, is the power which unites the
integrant particles of a body: the attraction of composition that which
combines the constituent particles. Is it not&nbsp;so?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Precisely: and observe that the attraction of cohesion unites
particles of a similar nature, without changing their original
properties; the result of such an union, therefore, is a body of the
same kind as the particles of which it is formed; whilst the attraction
of composition, by combining particles of a dissimilar nature, produces
compound bodies, quite different from any of their constituents. If, for
instance, I&nbsp;pour on the piece of copper, contained in this glass,
some of this liquid (which is called nitric acid), for which it has a
strong attraction, every particle of the copper will combine with a
particle of acid, and together they will form a new body, totally
different from either the copper or the acid.</p>

<p>Do you observe the internal commotion that already begins to take
place? It is produced by the combination of these two substances; and
yet the acid has in this case to overcome not only the resistance which
the strong cohesion of the particles of copper opposes to their
combination with it, but also to overcome the weight of the copper,
which
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<a name = "page18" id = "page18"> </a>
makes it sink to the bottom of the glass, and prevents the acid from
having such free access to it as it would if the metal were suspended in
the liquid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The acid seems, however, to overcome both these obstacles without
difficulty, and appears to be very rapidly dissolving the copper.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By this means it reduces the copper into more minute parts than could
possibly be done by any mechanical power. But as the acid can act only
on the surface of the metal, it will be some time before the union of
these two bodies will be completed.</p>

<p>You may, however, already see how totally different this compound is
from either of its ingredients. It is neither colourless, like the acid,
nor hard, heavy, and yellow like the copper. If you tasted it, you would
no longer perceive the sourness of the acid. It has at present the
appearance of a blue liquid; but when the union is completed, and the
water with which the acid is diluted is evaporated, the compound will
assume the form of regular crystals, of a fine blue colour, and
perfectly transparent<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href =
"#note6">*</a>. Of these I can shew you a
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<a name = "page19" id = "page19"> </a>
specimen, as I have prepared some for that purpose.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How very beautiful they are, in colour, form, and transparency!</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more striking than this example of chemical
attraction.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The term <i>attraction</i> has been lately introduced into chemistry
as a substitute for the word <i>affinity</i>, to which some chemists
have objected, because it originated in the vague notion that chemical
combinations depended upon a certain resemblance, or relationship,
between particles that are disposed to unite; and this idea is not only
imperfect, but erroneous, as it is generally particles of the most
dissimilar nature, that have the greatest tendency to combine.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Besides, there seems to be no advantage in using a variety of terms
to express the same meaning; on the contrary it creates confusion; and
as we are well acquainted with the term Attraction in natural
philosophy, we had better adopt it in chemistry likewise.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<a name = "page20" id = "page20"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>If you have a clear idea of the meaning, I&nbsp;shall leave you at
liberty to express it in the terms you prefer. For myself,
I&nbsp;confess that I think the word Attraction best suited to the
general law that unites the integrant particles of bodies; and Affinity
better adapted to that which combines the constituent particles, as it
may convey an idea of the preference which some bodies have for others,
which the term <i>attraction of composition</i> does not so well
express.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>So I think; for though that preference may not result from any
relationship, or similitude, between the particles (as you say was once
supposed), yet, as it really exists, it ought to be expressed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Well, let it be agreed that you may use the terms <i>affinity</i>,
<i>chemical attraction</i> and <i>attraction of composition</i>,
indifferently, provided you recollect that they have all the same
meaning.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I do not conceive how bodies can be decomposed by chemical
attraction. That this power should be the means of composing them, is
very obvious; but that it should, at the same time, produce exactly the
contrary effect, appears to me very singular.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<a name = "page21" id = "page21"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>To decompose a body is, you know, to separate its constituent parts,
which, as we have just observed, cannot be done by mechanical means.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>No: because mechanical means separate only the integrant particles;
they act merely against the attraction of cohesion, and only divide a
compound into smaller parts.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The decomposition of a body is performed by chemical powers. If you
present to a body composed of two principles, a&nbsp;third, which has a
greater affinity for one of them than the two first have for each other,
it will be decomposed, that is, its two principles will be separated by
means of the third body. Let us call two ingredients, of which the body
is composed, A&nbsp;and&nbsp;B. If we present to it another
ingredient&nbsp;C, which has a greater affinity for B than that which
unites A and&nbsp;B, it necessarily follows that B will quit A to
combine with&nbsp;C. The new ingredient, therefore, has effected a
decomposition of the original body A&nbsp;B; A&nbsp;has been left alone,
and a new compound, B&nbsp;C, has been formed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>We might, I think, use the comparison of two
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<a name = "page22" id = "page22"> </a>
friends, who were very happy in each other’s society, till a third
disunited them by the preference which one of them gave to the
new-comer.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well. I shall now show you how this takes place in
chemistry.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that we wish to decompose the compound we have just
formed by the combination of the two ingredients, copper and nitric
acid; we may do this by presenting to it a piece of iron, for which the
acid has a stronger attraction than for copper; the acid will,
consequently, quit the copper to combine with the iron, and the copper
will be what the chemists call <i>precipitated</i>, that is to say, it
will be thrown down in its separate state, and reappear in its simple
form.</p>

<p>In order to produce this effect, I shall dip the blade of this knife
into the fluid, and, when I take it out, you will observe, that, instead
of being wetted with a bluish liquid, like that contained in the glass,
it will be covered with a thin coat of copper.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>So it is really! but then is it not the copper, instead of the acid,
that has combined with the iron blade?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; you are deceived by appearances: it is
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<a name = "page23" id = "page23"> </a>
the acid which combines with the iron, and, in so doing, deposits or
precipitates the copper on the surface of the blade.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But, cannot three or more substances combine together, without any of
them being precipitated?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is sometimes the case; but, in general, the stronger affinity
destroys the weaker; and it seldom happens that the attraction of
several substances for each other is so equally balanced as to produce
such complicated compounds.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But, pray, Mrs. B., what is the cause of the chemical attraction of
bodies for each other? It appears to me more extraordinary or unnatural,
if I may use the expression, than the attraction of cohesion, which
unites particles of a similar nature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Chemical attraction may, like that of cohesion or gravitation, be one
of the powers inherent in matter which, in our present state of
knowledge, admits of no other satisfactory explanation than an immediate
reference to a divine cause. Sir H. Davy, however, whose important
discoveries have
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<a name = "page24" id = "page24"> </a>
opened such improved views in chemistry, has suggested an hypothesis
which may throw great light upon that science. He supposes that there
are two kinds of electricity, with one or other of which all bodies are
united. These we distinguish by the names of <i>positive</i> and
<i>negative</i> electricity; those bodies are disposed to combine, which
possess opposite electricities, as they are brought together by the
attraction which these electricities have for each other. But, whether
this hypothesis be altogether founded on truth or not, it is impossible
to question the great influence of electricity in chemical
combinations.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>So, that we must suppose that the two electricities always attract
each other, and thus compel the bodies in which they exist to
combine?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And may not this be also the cause of the attraction of cohesion?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No, for in particles of the same nature the same electricities must
prevail, and it is only the different or opposite electric fluids that
attract each other.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>These electricities seem to me to be a kind of
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<a name = "page25" id = "page25"> </a>
chemical spirit, which animates the particles of bodies, and draws them
together.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>If it is known, then, with which of the electricities bodies are
united, it can be inferred which will, and which will not, combine
together?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly.&mdash;I should not omit to mention, that some doubts have
been entertained whether electricity be really a material agent, or
whether it might not be a power inherent in bodies, similar to, or,
perhaps identical with, attraction.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But what then would be the electric spark which is visible, <ins
class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘aud’">and</ins> must therefore be
really material?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>What we call the electric spark, may, Sir H. Davy says, be merely the
heat and light, or fire produced by the chemical combinations with which
these phenomena are always connected. We will not, however, enter more
fully on this important subject at present, but reserve the principal
facts which relate to it to a future conversation.</p>

<p>Before we part, however, I must recommend you to fix in your memory
the names of the simple bodies, against our next interview.</p>

<div class = "footnote">

<p><a name = "note1" id = "note1" href = "#tag1">*</a>
It has been questioned by some eminent chemists, whether these two last
agents should not be classed among the inflammable bodies, as they are
capable of combining with oxygen, as well as with inflammable bodies.
But they seem to be more distinctly characterised by their property of
supporting combustion than by any other quality.</p>

Of all these earths, three or four only have as yet been distinctly
decomposed.</p>

<p><a name = "note3" id = "note3" href = "#tag3">*</a>

appellation of perfect or noble metals, on account of their possessing

inalterability, and great specific gravity, in an eminent degree.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">W</span>e</span> have learned by heart the names of all
the simple bodies which you have enumerated, and we are now ready to
enter on the examination of each of them successively. You will begin,
I&nbsp;suppose, with <span class = "smallroman">LIGHT</span>?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Respecting the nature of light we have little more than conjectures.
It is considered by most philosophers as a real substance, immediately
emanating from the sun, and from all luminous bodies, from which it is
projected in right lines with prodigious velocity. Light, however, being
imponderable, it cannot be confined and examined by itself; and
therefore it is to the effects it produces on other bodies, rather than
to its immediate nature, that we must direct our attention.</p>

<p>The connection between light and heat is very obvious; indeed, it is
such, that it is extremely
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<a name = "page27" id = "page27"> </a>
difficult to examine the one independently of the other.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But, is it possible to separate light from heat; I&nbsp;thought they
were only different degrees of the same thing, fire?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I told you that fire was not now considered as a simple element.
Whether light and heat be altogether different agents, or not,
I&nbsp;cannot pretend to decide; but, in many cases, light may be
separated from heat. The first discovery of this was made by a
celebrated Swedish chemist, Scheele. Another very striking illustration
of the separation of heat and light was long after pointed out by Dr.
Herschell. This philosopher discovered that these two agents were
emitted in the rays of the sun, and that heat was less refrangible than
light; for, in separating the different coloured rays of light by a
prism (as we did some time ago), he found that the greatest heat was
beyond the spectrum, at a little distance from the red rays, which, you
may recollect, are the least refrangible.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I should like to try that experiment.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<a name = "page28" id = "page28"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is by no means an easy one: the heat of a ray of light, refracted
by a prism, is so small, that it requires a very delicate thermometer to
distinguish the difference of the degree of heat within and without the
spectrum. For in this experiment the heat is not totally separated from
the light, each coloured ray retaining a certain portion of it, though
the greatest part is not sufficiently refracted to fall within the
spectrum.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I suppose, then, that those coloured rays which are the least
refrangible, retain the greatest quantity of heat?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They do so.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Though I no longer doubt that light and heat can be separated, Dr.
Herschell’s experiment does not appear to me to afford sufficient proof
that they are essentially different; for light, which you call a simple
body, may likewise be divided into the various coloured rays.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No doubt there must be some difference in the various coloured rays.
Even their chemical powers
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<a name = "page29" id = "page29"> </a>
are different. The blue rays, for instance, have the greatest effect in
separating oxygen from bodies, as was found by Scheele; and there exist
also, as Dr. Wollaston has shown, rays more refrangible than the blue,
which produce the same chemical effect, and, what is very remarkable,
are invisible.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Do you think it possible that heat may be merely a modification of
light?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is a supposition which, in the present state of natural
philosophy, can neither be positively affirmed nor denied. Let us,
therefore, instead of discussing theoretical points, be contented with
examining what is known respecting the chemical effects of light.</p>

<p>Light is capable of entering into a kind of transitory union with
certain substances, and this is what has been called phosphorescence.
Bodies that are possessed of this property, after being exposed to the
sun’s rays, appear luminous in the dark. The shells of fish, the bones
of land animals, marble, limestone, and a variety of combinations of
earths, are more or less powerfully phosphorescent.</p>

<p>I remember being much surprised last summer with the phosphorescent
appearance of some pieces of rotten wood, which had just been dug out of
the ground; they shone so bright that I at first supposed them to be
glow-worms.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And is not the light of a glow-worm of a phosphorescent nature?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is a very remarkable instance of phosphorescence in living
animals; this property, however, is not exclusively possessed by the
glow-worm. The insect called the lanthorn-fly, which is peculiar to warm
climates, emits light as it flies, producing in the dark a remarkably
sparkling appearance. But it is more common to see animal matter in a
dead state possessed of a phosphorescent quality; sea fish is often
eminently&nbsp;so.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I have heard that the sea has sometimes had the appearance of being
illuminated, and that the light is supposed to proceed from the spawn of
fishes floating on its surface.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<a name = "page31" id = "page31"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This light is probably owing to that or some other animal matter. Sea
water has been observed to become luminous from the substance of a fresh
herring having been immersed in it; and certain insects, of the Medusa
kind, are known to produce similar effects.</p>

<p>But the strongest phosphorescence is produced by chemical
compositions prepared for the purpose, the most common of which consists
of oyster shells and sulphur, and is known by the name of Canton’s
Phosphorus.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I am rather surprised, Mrs. B., that you should have said so much of
the light emitted by phosphorescent bodies without taking any notice of
that which is produced by burning bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The light emitted by the latter is so intimately connected with the
chemical history of combustion, that I must defer all explanation of it
till we come to the examination of that process, which is one of the
most interesting in chemical science.</p>

<p>Light is an agent capable of producing various chemical changes. It
is essential to the welfare both of the animal and vegetable kingdoms;
for men and plants grow pale and sickly if deprived of
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<a name = "page32" id = "page32"> </a>
its salutary influence. It is likewise remarkable for its property of
destroying colour, which renders it of great consequence in the process
of bleaching.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is it not singular that light, which in studying optics we were
taught to consider as the source and origin of colours, should have also
the power of destroying them?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is a fact, however, that we every day experience; you know how it
fades the colours of linens and silks.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Certainly. And I recollect that endive is made to grow white instead
of green, by being covered up so as to exclude the light. But by what
means does light produce these effects?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This I cannot attempt to explain to you until you have obtained a
further knowledge of chemistry. As the chemical properties of light can
be accounted for only in their reference to compound bodies, it would be
useless to detain you any longer on this subject; we may therefore pass
on to the examination of heat, or caloric, with which we are somewhat
better acquainted.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Heat</span> and <span class =

sensations they produce, <i>Light</i> affects the sense of sight;
<i>Caloric</i> that of feeling; the one produces <i>Vision</i>, the
other the sensation of <i>Heat</i>.</p>

<p>Caloric is found to exist in a variety of forms or modifications, and
I think it will be best to consider it under the two following heads,
viz.</p>

<div class = "inset">
<p>1. <span class = "smallroman">FREE OR RADIANT CALORIC</span>.</p>

<p>2. <span class = "smallroman">COMBINED CALORIC</span>.</p>

<p>The first, <span class = "smallroman">FREE</span> or <span class =
"smallroman">RADIANT CALORIC</span>, is also called <span class =
"smallroman">HEAT OF TEMPERATURE</span>; it comprehends all heat which
is perceptible to the senses, and affects the thermometer.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>You mean such as the heat of the sun, of fire, of candles, of stoves;
in short, of every thing that burns?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And likewise of things that do not burn, as, for instance, the warmth
of the body; in a word, all heat that is <i>sensible</i>, whatever may
be its degree, or the source from which it is derived.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What then are the other modifications of caloric?
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
<a name = "page34" id = "page34"> </a>
It must be a strange kind of heat that cannot be perceived by our
senses.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>None of the modifications of caloric should properly be called
<i>heat</i>; for heat, strictly speaking, is the sensation produced by
caloric, on animated bodies; this word, therefore, in the accurate
language of science, should be confined to express the sensation. But
custom has adapted it likewise to inanimate matter, and we say <i>the
heat of an oven</i>, <i>the heat of the sun</i>, without any reference
to the sensation which they are capable of exciting.</p>

<p>It was in order to avoid the confusion which arose from thus
confounding the cause and effect, that modern chemists adopted the new
word <i>caloric</i>, to denote the principle which produces heat; yet
they do not always, in compliance with their own language, limit the
word <i>heat</i> to the expression of the sensation, since they still
frequently employ it in reference to the other modifications of caloric
which are quite independent of sensation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But you have not yet explained to us what these other modifications
of caloric are.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because you are not acquainted with the properties
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<a name = "page35" id = "page35"> </a>
of free caloric, and you know that we have agreed to proceed with
regularity.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable properties of free caloric is its power of
<i>dilating</i> bodies. This fluid is so extremely subtle, that it
enters and pervades all bodies whatever, forces itself between their
particles, and not only separates them, but frequently drives them
asunder to a considerable distance from each other. It is thus that
caloric dilates or expands a body so as to make it occupy a greater
space than it did before.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The effect it has on bodies, therefore, is directly contrary to that
of the attraction of cohesion; the one draws the particles together, the
other drives them asunder.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Precisely. There is a continual struggle between the attraction of
aggregation, and the expansive power of caloric; and from the action of
these two opposite forces, result all the various forms of matter, or
degrees of consistence, from the solid, to the liquid and aëriform
state. And accordingly we find that most bodies are capable of passing
from one of these forms to the other, merely in consequence of their
receiving different quantities of caloric.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<a name = "page36" id = "page36"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That is very curious; but I think I understand the reason of it. If a
great quantity of caloric is added to a solid body, it introduces itself
between the particles in such a manner as to overcome, in a considerable
degree, the attraction of cohesion; and the body, from a solid, is then
converted into a fluid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This is the case whenever a body is fused or melted; but if you add
caloric to a liquid, can you tell me what is the consequence?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The caloric forces itself in greater abundance between the particles
of the fluid, and drives them to such a distance from each other, that
their attraction of aggregation is wholly destroyed: the liquid is then
transformed into vapour.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well; and this is precisely the case with boiling water, when it
is converted into steam or vapour, and with all bodies that assume an
aëriform state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I do not well understand the word aëriform?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<a name = "page37" id = "page37"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Any elastic fluid whatever, whether it be merely vapour or permanent
air, is called aëriform.</p>

<p>But each of these various states, solid, liquid, and aëriform, admit
of many different degrees of density, or consistence, still arising
(chiefly at least) from the different quantities of caloric the bodies
contain. Solids are of various degrees of density, from that of gold, to
that of a thin jelly. Liquids, from the consistence of melted glue, or
melted metals, to that of ether, which is the lightest of all liquids.
The different elastic fluids (with which you are not yet acquainted) are
susceptible of no less variety in their degrees of density.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But does not every individual body also admit of different degrees of
consistence, without changing its state?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly; and this I can immediately show you by a very simple
experiment. This piece of iron now exactly fits the frame, or ring, made
to receive it; but if heated red hot, it will no longer do so, for its
dimensions will be so much increased by the caloric that has penetrated
into it, that it will be much too large for the frame.</p>

<p>The iron is now red hot; by applying it to the frame, we shall see
how much it is dilated.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
<a name = "page38" id = "page38"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Considerably so indeed! I knew that heat had this effect on bodies,
but I did not imagine that it could be made so conspicuous.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By means of this instrument (called a Pyrometer) we may estimate, in
the most exact manner, the various dilatations of any solid body by
heat. The body we are now going to submit to trial is this small iron
bar; I&nbsp;fix it to this apparatus, (<a class = "smallcaps" href =
"#plateI">Plate&nbsp;I.</a> Fig.&nbsp;<ins class = "mycorr" title =
"text reads ‘I’">1</ins>.) and then heat it by lighting the three lamps
beneath it: when the bar expands, it increases in length as well as
thickness; and, as one end communicates with this wheel-work, whilst the
other end is fixed and immoveable, no sooner does it begin to dilate
than it presses against the wheel-work, and sets in motion the index,
which points out the degrees of dilatation on the dial-plate.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This is, indeed, a very curious instrument; but I do not understand
the use of the wheels: would it not be more simple, and answer the
purpose equally well, if the bar, in dilating, pressed against the
index, and put it in motion without the intervention of the wheels?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<a name = "page39" id = "page39"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The use of the wheels is merely to multiply the motion, and therefore
render the effect of the caloric more obvious; for if the index moved no
more than the bar increased in length, its motion would scarcely be
perceptible; but by means of the wheels it moves in a much greater
proportion, which therefore renders the variations far more
conspicuous.</p>

<p>By submitting different bodies to the test of the pyrometer, it is
found that they are far from dilating in the same proportion. Different
metals expand in different degrees, and other kinds of solid bodies vary
still more in this respect. But this different susceptibility of
dilatation is still more remarkable in fluids than in solid bodies, as I
shall show you. I&nbsp;have here two glass tubes, terminated at one end
by large bulbs. We shall fill the bulbs, the one with spirit of wine,
the other with water. I&nbsp;have coloured both liquids, in order that
the effect may be more conspicuous. The spirit of wine, you see, dilates
by the warmth of my hand as I hold the bulb.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It certainly does, for I see it is rising into the tube. But water,
it seems, is not so easily affected by heat; for scarcely any change is
produced on it by the warmth of the hand.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
<a name = "page40" id = "page40"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>True; we shall now plunge the bulbs into hot water, (<a class =
"smallcaps" href = "#plateI">Plate I.</a> Fig.&nbsp;2.) and you will see
both liquids rise in the tubes; but the spirit of wine will ascend
highest.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How rapidly it expands! Now it has nearly reached the top of the
tube, though the water has hardly begun to rise.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The water now begins to dilate. Are not these glass tubes, with
liquids rising within them, very like thermometers?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>A thermometer is constructed exactly on the same principle, and these
tubes require only a scale to answer the purpose of thermometers: but
they would be rather awkward in their dimensions. The tubes and bulbs of
thermometers, though of various sizes, are in general much smaller than
these; the tube too is hermetically closed, and the air excluded from
it. The fluid most generally used in thermometers is mercury, commonly
called quicksilver, the dilatations and contractions of which correspond
more exactly to the additions, and subtractions, of caloric, than those
of any other fluid.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<a name = "page41" id = "page41"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yet I have often seen coloured spirit of wine used in
thermometers.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The expansions and contractions of that liquid are not quite so
uniform as those of mercury; but in cases in which it is not requisite
to ascertain the temperature with great precision, spirit of wine will
answer the purpose equally well, and indeed in some respects better, as
the expansion of the latter is greater, and therefore more conspicuous.
This fluid is used likewise in situations and experiments in which
mercury would be frozen; for mercury becomes a solid body, like a piece
of lead or any other metal, at a certain degree of cold: but no degree
of cold has ever been known to freeze spirit of wine.</p>

<p>A thermometer, therefore, consists of a tube with a bulb, such as you
see here, containing a fluid whose degrees of dilatation and contraction
are indicated by a scale to which the tube is fixed. The degree which
indicates the boiling point, simply means that, when the fluid is
sufficiently dilated to rise to this point, the heat is such that water
exposed to the same temperature will boil. When, on the other hand, the
fluid is so much condensed as to sink to the freezing point, we know
that water will freeze at that temperature.
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
<a name = "page42" id = "page42"> </a>
The extreme points of the scales are not the same in all thermometers,
nor are the degrees always divided in the same manner. In different
countries philosophers have chosen to adopt different scales and
divisions. The two thermometers most used are those of Fahrenheit, and
of Reaumur; the first is generally preferred by the English, the latter
by the French.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The variety of scale must be very inconvenient, and I should think
liable to occasion confusion, when French and English experiments are
compared.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The inconvenience is but very trifling, because the different
gradations of the scales do not affect the principle upon which
thermometers are constructed. When we know, for instance, that
Fahrenheit’s scale is divided into 212 degrees, in which 32° corresponds
with the freezing point, and 212° with the point of boiling water: and
that Reaumur’s is divided only into 80 degrees, in which 0° denotes the
freezing point, and 80° that of boiling water, it is easy to compare the
two scales together, and reduce the one into the other. But, for greater
convenience, thermometers are sometimes constructed with both these
scales, one
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
<a name = "page43" id = "page43"> </a>
on either side of the tube; so that the correspondence of the different
degrees of the two scales is thus instantly seen. Here is one of these
scales, (<a class = "smallcaps" href = "#plateII">Plate II.</a>
Fig.&nbsp;1.) by which you can at once perceive that each degree of
Reaumur’s corresponds to 2¼ of Fahrenheit’s division. But I believe the
French have, of late, given the preference to what they call the
centigrade scale, in which the space between the freezing and the
boiling point is divided into 100 degrees.</p>

<p>That seems to me the most reasonable division, and I cannot guess why
the freezing point is called 32°, or what advantage is derived
from&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There really is no advantage in it; and it originated in a mistaken
opinion of the instrument-maker, Fahrenheit, who first constructed these
thermometers. He mixed snow and salt together, and produced by that
means a degree of cold which he concluded was the greatest possible, and
therefore made his scale begin from that point. Between that and boiling
water he made 212 degrees, and the freezing point was found to be at
32°.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
<a name = "page44" id = "page44"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Are spirit of wine, and mercury, the only liquids used in the
construction of thermometers?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I believe they are the only liquids now in use, though some others,
such as linseed oil, would make tolerable thermometers: but for
experiments in which a very quick and delicate test of the changes of
temperature is required, air is the fluid sometimes employed. The bulb
of air thermometers is filled with common air only, and its expansion
and contraction are indicated by a small drop of any coloured liquor,
which is suspended within the tube, and moves up and down, according as
the air within the bulb and tube expands or contracts. But in general,
air thermometers, however sensible to changes of temperature, are by no
means accurate in their indications.</p>

<p>I can, however, show you an air thermometer of a very peculiar
construction, which is remarkably well adapted for some chemical
experiments, as it is equally delicate and accurate in its
indications.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It looks like a double thermometer reversed, the tube being bent, and
having a large bulb at each of its extremities. (<a class = "smallcaps"
href = "#plateII">Plate II.</a> Fig.&nbsp;2.)</p>

<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<a name = "page45" id = "page45"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Why do you call it an air thermometer; the tube contains a coloured
liquid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But observe that the bulbs are filled with air, the liquid being
confined to a portion of the tube, and answering only the purpose of
showing, by its motion in the tube, the comparative dilatation or
contraction of the air within the bulbs, which afford an indication of
their relative temperature. Thus if you heat the bulb&nbsp;A, by the
warmth of your hand, the fluid will rise towards the bulb&nbsp;B, and
the contrary will happen if you reverse the experiment.</p>

<p>But if, on the contrary, both tubes are of the same temperature, as
is the case now, the coloured liquid, suffering an equal pressure on
each side, no change of level takes place.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This instrument appears, indeed, uncommonly delicate. The fluid is
set in motion by the mere approach of my hand.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You must observe, however, that this thermometer cannot indicate the
temperature of any particular body, or of the medium in which it is
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<a name = "page46" id = "page46"> </a>
immersed; it serves only to point out the <i>difference</i> of
temperature between the two bulbs, when placed under different
circumstances. For this reason it has been called <ins class = "mycorr"
title = "missing ‘a’ or ‘the’?"><i>differential</i></ins> thermometer.
You will see by-and-bye to what particular purposes this instrument
applies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But do common thermometers indicate the exact quantity of caloric
contained either in the atmosphere, or in any body with which they are
in contact?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No: first, because there are other modifications of caloric which do
not affect the thermometer; and, secondly, because the temperature of a
body, as indicated by the thermometer, is only relative. When, for
instance, the thermometer remains stationary at the freezing point, we
know that the atmosphere (or medium in which it is placed, whatever it
may be) is as cold as freezing water; and when it stands at the boiling
point, we know that this medium is as hot as boiling water; but we do
not know the positive quantity of heat contained either in freezing or
boiling water, any more than we know the real extremes of heat and cold;
and consequently we cannot determine that of the body in which the
thermometer is placed.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<a name = "page47" id = "page47"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I do not quite understand this explanation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Let us compare a thermometer to a well, in which the water rises to
different heights, according as it is more or less supplied by the
spring which feeds it: if the depth of the well is unfathomable, it must
be impossible to know the absolute quantity of water it contains; yet we
can with the greatest accuracy measure the number of feet the water has
risen or fallen in the well at any time, and consequently know the
precise quantity of its increase or diminution, without having the least
knowledge of the whole quantity of water it contains.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Now I comprehend it very well; nothing appears to me to explain a
thing so clearly as a comparison.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But will thermometers bear any degree of heat?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; for if the temperature were much above the highest degree marked
on the scale of the thermometer, the mercury would burst the tube in an
attempt to ascend. And at any rate, no thermometer can be applied to
temperatures higher than the boiling
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<a name = "page48" id = "page48"> </a>
point of the liquid used in its construction, for the steam, on the
liquid beginning to boil, would burst the tube. In furnaces, or whenever
any very high temperature is to be measured, a&nbsp;pyrometer, invented
by Wedgwood, is used for that purpose. It is made of a certain
composition of baked clay, which has the peculiar property of
contracting by heat, so that the degree of contraction of this substance
indicates the temperature to which it has been exposed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But is it possible for a body to contract by heat? I&nbsp;thought
that heat dilated all bodies whatever.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This is not an exception to the rule. You must recollect that the
bulk of the clay is not compared, whilst hot, with that which it has
when cold; but it is from the change which the clay has undergone by
<i>having been</i> heated that the indications of this instrument are
derived. This change consists in a beginning fusion which tends to unite
the particles of clay more closely, thus rendering it less pervious or
spongy.</p>

<p>Clay is to be considered as a spongy body, having many interstices or
pores, from its having contained water when soft. These interstices are
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<a name = "page49" id = "page49"> </a>
by heat lessened, and would by extreme heat be entirely obliterated.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And how do you ascertain the degrees of contraction of Wedgwood’s
pyrometer?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The dimensions of a piece of clay are measured by a scale graduated
on the side of a tapered groove, formed in a brass ruler; the more the
clay is contracted by the heat, the further it will descend into the
narrow part of the tube.</p>

<p>Before we quit the subject of expansion, I&nbsp;must observe to you
that, as liquids expand more readily than solids, so elastic fluids,
whether air or vapour, are the most expansible of all bodies.</p>

<p>It may appear extraordinary that all elastic fluids whatever, undergo
the same degree of expansion from equal augmentations of
temperature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I suppose, then, that all elastic fluids are of the same density?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very far from it; they vary in density, more than either liquids or
solids. The uniformity of their expansibility, which at first may appear
singular, is, however, readily accounted for. For if the different
susceptibilities of expansion of bodies
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<a name = "page50" id = "page50"> </a>
arise from their various degrees of attraction of cohesion, no such
difference can be expected in elastic fluids, since in these the
attraction of cohesion does not exist, their particles being on the
contrary possessed of an elastic or repulsive power; they will therefore
all be equally expanded by equal degrees of caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>True; as there is no power opposed to the expansive force of caloric
in elastic bodies, its effect must be the same in all of them.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Let us now proceed to examine the other properties of free
caloric.</p>

<p>Free caloric always tends to diffuse itself equally, that is to say,
when two bodies are of different temperatures, the warmer gradually
parts with its heat to the colder, till they are both brought to the
same temperature. Thus, when a thermometer is applied to a hot body, it
receives caloric; when to a cold one, it communicates part of its own
caloric, and this communication continues until the thermometer and the
body arrive at the same temperature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Cold, then, is nothing but a negative quality, simply implying the
absence of heat.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<a name = "page51" id = "page51"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not the total absence, but a diminution of heat; for we know of no
body in which some caloric may not be discovered.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But when I lay my hand on this marble table I feel it
<i>positively</i> cold, and cannot conceive that there is any caloric
in&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The cold you experience consists in the loss of caloric that your
hand sustains in an attempt to bring its temperature to an equilibrium
with the marble. If you lay a piece of ice upon it, you will find that
the contrary effect will take place; the ice will be melted by the heat
which it abstracts from the marble.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is it not in this case the air of the room, which being warmer than
the marble, melts the ice?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The air certainly acts on the surface which is exposed to it, but the
table melts that part with which it is in contact.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But why does caloric tend to an equilibrium?
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
<a name = "page52" id = "page52"> </a>
It cannot be on the same principle as other fluids, since it has no
weight?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very true, Caroline, that is an excellent objection. You might also,
with some propriety, object to the term <i>equilibrium</i> being applied
to a body that is without weight; but I know of no expression that would
explain my meaning so well. You must consider it, however, in a
figurative rather than a literal sense; its strict meaning is an
<i>equal diffusion</i>. We cannot, indeed, well say by what power it
diffuses itself equally, though it is not surprising that it should go
from the parts which have the most to those which have the least. This
subject is best explained by a theory suggested by Professor Prevost of
Geneva, which is now, I&nbsp;believe, generally adopted.</p>

<p>According to this theory, caloric is composed of particles perfectly
separate from each other, every one of which moves with a rapid velocity
in a certain direction. These directions vary as much as imagination can
conceive, the result of which is, that there are rays or lines of these
particles moving with immense velocity in every possible direction.
Caloric is thus universally diffused, so that when any portion of space
happens to be in the neighbourhood of another, which contains more
caloric, the colder portion receives a
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<a name = "page53" id = "page53"> </a>
quantity of calorific rays from the latter, sufficient to restore an
equilibrium of temperature. This radiation does not only take place in
free space, but extends also to bodies of every kind. Thus you may
suppose all bodies whatever constantly radiating caloric: those that are
of the same temperature give out and absorb equal quantities, so that no
variation of temperature is produced in them; but when one body contains
more free caloric than another, the exchange is always in favour of the
colder body, until an equilibrium is effected; this you found to be the
case when the marble table cooled your hand, and again when it melted
the ice.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This reciprocal radiation surprises me extremely; I&nbsp;thought,
from what you first said, that the hotter bodies alone emitted rays of
caloric which were absorbed by the colder; for it seems unnatural that a
hot body should receive any caloric from a cold one, even though it
should return a greater quantity.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It may at first appear so, but it is no more extraordinary than that
a candle should send forth rays of light to the sun, which, you know,
must necessarily happen.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
<a name = "page54" id = "page54"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Well, Mrs. B&mdash;, I believe that I must give up the point. But I
wish I could <i>see</i> these rays of caloric; I&nbsp;should then have
greater faith in them.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Will you give no credit to any sense but that of sight? You may feel
the rays of caloric which you receive from any body of a temperature
higher than your own; the loss of the caloric you part with in return,
it is true, is not perceptible; for as you gain more than you lose,
instead of suffering a diminution, you are really making an acquisition
of caloric. It is, therefore, only when you are parting with it to a
body of a lower temperature, that you are sensible of the sensation of
cold, because you then sustain an absolute loss of caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And in this case we cannot be sensible of the small quantity of heat
we receive in exchange from the colder body, because it serves only to
diminish the loss.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well, indeed, Emily. Professor Pictet, of Geneva, has made some
very interesting experiments, which prove not only that caloric radiates
from all bodies whatever, but that these rays may be reflected,
according to the laws of optics, in
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<a name = "page55" id = "page55"> </a>
the same manner as light. I&nbsp;shall repeat these experiments before
you, having procured mirrors fit for the purpose; and it will afford us
an opportunity of using the differential thermometer, which is
particularly well adapted for these experiments.&mdash;I&nbsp;place an
iron bullet, (<a class = "smallcaps" href = "#plateIII">Plate III.</a>
Fig.&nbsp;<ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘I’">1</ins>.) about
two inches in diameter, and heated to a degree not sufficient to render
it luminous, in the focus of this large metallic concave mirror. The
rays of heat which fall on this mirror are reflected, agreeably to the
property of concave mirrors, in a parallel direction, so as to fall on a
similar mirror, which, you see, is placed opposite to the first, at the
distance of about ten feet; thence the rays converge to the focus of the
second mirror, in which I place one of the bulbs of this thermometer.
Now, observe in what manner it is affected by the caloric which is
reflected on it from the heated bullet.&mdash;The air is dilated in the
bulb which we placed in the focus of the mirror, and the liquor rises
considerably in the opposite leg.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But would not the same effect take place, if the rays of caloric from
the heated bullet fell directly on the thermometer, without the
assistance of the mirrors?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The effect would in that case be so trifling, at
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
<a name = "page56" id = "page56"> </a>
the distance at which the bullet and the thermometer are from each
other, that it would be almost imperceptible. The mirrors, you know,
greatly increase the effect, by collecting a large quantity of rays into
a focus; place your hand in the focus of the mirror, and you will find
it much hotter there than when you remove it nearer to the bullet.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That is very true; it appears extremely singular to feel the heat
diminish in approaching the body from which it proceeds.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And the mirror which produces so much heat, by converging the rays,
is itself quite cold.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The same number of rays that are dispersed over the surface of the
mirror are collected by it into the focus; but, if you consider how
large a surface the mirror presents to the rays, and, consequently, how
much they are diffused in comparison to what they are at the focus,
which is little more than a point, I&nbsp;think you can no longer wonder
that the focus should be so much hotter than the mirror.</p>

<p>The principal use of the mirrors in this experiment is, to prove that
the <ins class = "edcorr" title =
"corrected by author from ‘caloric’">calorific</ins>
emanation is reflected in the same manner as light.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<a name = "page57" id = "page57"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And the result, I think, is very conclusive.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The experiment may be repeated with a wax taper instead of the
bullet, with a view of separating the light from the caloric. For this
purpose a transparent plate of glass must be interposed between the
mirrors; for light, you know, passes with great facility through glass,
whilst the transmission of caloric is almost wholly impeded by it. We
shall find, however, in this experiment, that some few of the calorific
rays pass through the glass together with the light, as the thermometer
rises a little; but, as soon as the glass is removed, and a free passage
left to the caloric, it will rise considerably higher.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This experiment, as well as that of Dr. Herschell’s, proves that
light and heat may be separated; for in the latter experiment the
separation was not perfect, any more than in that of Mr. Pictet.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I should like to repeat this experiment, with the difference of
substituting a cold body instead of the hot one, to see whether cold
would not be reflected as well as heat.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
<a name = "page58" id = "page58"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That experiment was proposed to Mr. Pictet by an incredulous
philosopher like yourself, and he immediately tried it by substituting a
piece of ice in the place of the heated bullet.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Well, Mrs. B., and what was the result?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That we shall see; I have procured some ice for the purpose.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The thermometer falls considerably!</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And does not that prove that cold is not merely a <i>negative</i>
quality, implying simply an inferior degree of heat? The cold must be
<i>positive</i>, since it is capable of reflection.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>So it at first appeared to Mr. Pictet; but upon a little
consideration he found that it afforded only an additional proof of the
reflection of heat: this I shall endeavour to explain to you.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Prevost’s theory, we suppose that all bodies
whatever radiate caloric; the thermometer used in these experiments
therefore emits calorific rays in the same manner as any other
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<a name = "page59" id = "page59"> </a>
substance. When its temperature is in equilibrium with that of the
surrounding bodies, it receives as much caloric as it parts with, and no
change of temperature is produced. But when we introduce a body of a
lower temperature, such as a piece of ice, which parts with less caloric
than it receives, the consequence is, that its temperature is raised,
whilst that of the surrounding bodies is proportionally lowered.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>If, for instance, I was to bring a large piece of ice into this room,
the ice would in time be melted, by absorbing caloric from the general
radiation which is going on throughout the room; and as it would
contribute very little caloric in return for what is absorbed, the room
would necessarily be cooled by&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Just so; and as in consequence of the mirrors, a&nbsp;more
considerable exchange of rays takes place between the ice and the
thermometer, than between these and any of the surrounding bodies, the
temperature of the thermometer must be more lowered than that of any
other adjacent object.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I confess I do not perfectly understand your explanation.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<a name = "page60" id = "page60"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This experiment is exactly similar to that made with the heated
bullet: for, if we consider the thermometer as the hot body (which it
certainly is in comparison to the ice), you may then easily understand
that it is by the loss of the calorific rays which the thermometer sends
to the ice, and not by any cold rays received from it, that the fall of
the mercury is occasioned: for the ice, far from emitting rays of cold,
sends forth rays of caloric, which diminish the loss sustained by the
thermometer.</p>

<p>Let us say, for instance, that the radiation of the thermometer
towards the ice is equal to 20, and that of the ice towards the
thermometer to 10: the exchange in favour of the ice is as 20 is to 10,
or the thermometer absolutely loses 10, whilst the ice
gains&nbsp;10.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But if the ice actually sends rays of caloric to the thermometer,
must not the latter fall still lower when the ice is removed?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; for the space that the ice occupied, admits rays from all the
surrounding bodies to pass through it; and those being of the same
temperature as the thermometer, will not affect it, because as much heat
now returns to the thermometer as radiates from&nbsp;it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<a name = "page61" id = "page61"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I must confess that you have explained this in so satisfactory a
manner, that I cannot help being convinced now that cold has no real
claim to the rank of a positive being.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Before I conclude the subject of radiation I must observe to you that
different bodies, (or rather surfaces,) possess the power of radiating
caloric in very different degrees.</p>

<p>Some very curious experiments have been made by Mr. Leslie on this
subject, and it was for this purpose that he invented the differential
thermometer; with its assistance he ascertained that black surfaces
radiate most, glass next, and polished surfaces the least of all.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Supposing these surfaces, of course, to be all of the same
temperature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly. I will now show you the very simple and ingenious
apparatus, by means of which he made these experiments. This cubical tin
vessel or canister, has each of its sides externally covered with
different materials; the one is simply blackened; the next is covered
with white
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
<a name = "page62" id = "page62"> </a>
paper; the third with a pane of glass, and in the fourth the polished
tin surface remains uncovered. We shall fill this vessel with hot water,
so that there can be no doubt but that all its sides will be of the same
temperature. Now let us place it in the focus of one of the mirrors,
making each of its sides front it in succession. We shall begin with the
black surface.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It makes the thermometer which is in the focus of the other mirror
rise considerably. Let us turn the paper surface towards the mirror. The
thermometer falls a little, therefore of course this side cannot emit or
radiate so much caloric as the blackened side.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This is very surprising; for the sides are exactly of the same size,
and must be of the same temperature. But let us try the glass
surface.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The thermometer continues falling, and with the plain surface it
falls still lower; these two surfaces therefore radiate less and
less.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I think I have found out the reason of this.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<a name = "page63" id = "page63"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I should be very happy to hear it, for it has not yet (to my
knowledge) been accounted for.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The water within the vessel gradually cools, and the thermometer in
consequence gradually falls.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is true that the water cools, but certainly in much less
proportion than the thermometer descends, as you will perceive if you
now change the tin surface for the black one.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I was mistaken certainly, for the thermometer rises again now that
the black surface fronts the mirror.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And yet the water in the vessel is still cooling, Caroline.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I am surprised that the tin surface should radiate the least <ins
class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘carolic’">caloric</ins>, for a
metallic vessel filled with hot water, a&nbsp;silver teapot, for
instance, feels much hotter to the hand than one of black earthen
ware.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘54’">64</ins></span>
<a name = "page64" id = "page64"> </a>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is owing to the different power which various bodies possess for
<i>conducting</i> caloric, a&nbsp;property which we shall presently
examine. Thus, although a metallic vessel feels warmer to the hand,
a&nbsp;vessel of this kind is known to preserve the heat of the liquid
within, better than one of any other materials; it is for this reason
that silver teapots make better tea than those of earthen ware.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>According to these experiments, light-coloured dresses, in cold
weather, should keep us warmer than black clothes, since the latter
radiate so much more than the former.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And that is actually the case.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This property, of different surfaces to radiate in different degrees,
appears to me to be at variance with the equilibrium of caloric; since
it would imply that those bodies which radiate most, must ultimately
become coldest.</p>

<p>Suppose that we were to vary this experiment, by using two metallic
vessels full of boiling water, the one blackened, the other not; would
not the black one cool the first?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<a name = "page65" id = "page65"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>True; but when they were both brought down to the temperature of the
room, the interchange of caloric between the canisters and the other
bodies of the room being then equal, their temperatures would remain the
same.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I do not see why that should be the case; for if different surfaces
of the same temperature radiate in different degrees when heated, why
should they not continue to do so when cooled down to the temperature of
the room?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You have started a difficulty, Emily, which certainly requires
explanation. It is found by experiment that the power of absorption
corresponds with and is proportional to that of radiation; so that under
equal temperatures, bodies compensate for the greater loss they sustain
in consequence of their greater radiation by their greater absorption;
so that if you were to make your experiment in an atmosphere heated like
the canisters, to the temperature of boiling water, though it is true
that the canisters would radiate in different degrees, no change of
temperature would be produced in them, because they would each absorb
caloric in proportion to their respective radiation.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
<a name = "page66" id = "page66"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But would not the canisters of boiling water also absorb caloric in
different degrees in a room of the common temperature?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly they would. But the various bodies in the room would not,
at a lower temperature, furnish either of the canisters with a
sufficiency of caloric to compensate for the loss they undergo; for,
suppose the black canister to absorb 400 rays of caloric, whilst the
metallic one absorbed only 200; yet if the former radiate 800, whilst
the latter radiates only 400, the black canister will be the first
cooled down to the temperature of the room. But from the moment the
equilibrium of temperature has taken place, the black canister, both
receiving and giving out 400 rays, and the metallic one 200, no change
of temperature will take place.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I now understand it extremely well. But what becomes of the surplus
of calorific rays, which good radiators emit and bad radiators refuse to
receive; they must wander about in search of a resting-place?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They really do so; for they are rejected and sent
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<a name = "page67" id = "page67"> </a>
back, or, in other words, <i>reflected</i> by the bodies which are bad
radiators of caloric; and they are thus transmitted to other bodies
which happen to lie in their way, by which they are either absorbed or
again reflected, according as the property of reflection, or that of
absorption, predominates in these bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I do not well understand the difference between radiating and
reflecting caloric, for the caloric that is reflected from a body
proceeds from it in straight lines, and may surely be said to radiate
from&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is true that there at first appears to be a great analogy between
<i>radiation</i> and <i>reflection</i>, as they equally convey the idea
of the transmission of caloric.</p>

<p>But if you consider a little, you will perceive that when a body
<i>radiates</i> caloric, the heat which it emits not only proceeds from,
but has its origin in the body itself. Whilst when a body
<i>reflects</i> caloric, it parts with none of its own caloric, but only
reflects that which it receives from other bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Of this difference we have very striking examples before us, in the
tin vessel of water, and the concave mirrors; the first radiates its own
heat,
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
<a name = "page68" id = "page68"> </a>
the latter reflect the heat which they receive from other bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Now, that I understand the difference, it no longer surprises me that
bodies which radiate, or part with their own caloric freely, should not
have the power of transmitting with equal facility that which they
receive from other bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yet no body can be said to possess caloric of its own, if all caloric
is originally derived from the sun.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>When I speak of a body radiating its own caloric, I&nbsp;mean that
which it has absorbed and incorporated either immediately from the sun’s
rays, or through the medium of any other substance.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It seems natural enough that the power of absorption should be in
opposition to that of reflection, for the more caloric a body receives,
the less it will reject.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And equally so that the power of radiation should correspond with
that of absorption. It is, in fact, cause and effect; for a body cannot
radiate
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
<a name = "page69" id = "page69"> </a>
heat without having previously absorbed it; just as a spring that is
well fed flows abundantly.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Fluids are in general very bad radiators of caloric; and air neither
radiates nor absorbs caloric in any sensible degree.</p>

<p>We have not yet concluded our observations on free caloric. But I
shall defer, till our next meeting, what I have further to say on this
subject. I&nbsp;believe it will afford us ample conversation for another
interview.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">I</span>n</span> our last conversation, we began to
examine the tendency of caloric to restore an equilibrium of
temperature. This property, when once well understood, affords the
explanation of a great variety of facts which appeared formerly
unaccountable. You must observe, in the first place, that the effect of
this tendency is gradually to bring all bodies that are in contact to
the same temperature. Thus, the fire which burns in the grate,
communicates its heat from one object to another, till every part of the
room has an equal proportion of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And yet this book is not so cold as the table on which it lies,
though both are at an equal distance from the fire, and actually in
contact with each other, so that, according to your theory, they should
be exactly of the same temperature.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<a name = "page71" id = "page71"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And the hearth, which is much nearer the fire than the carpet, is
certainly the colder of the two.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>If you ascertain the temperature of these several bodies by a
thermometer (which is a much more accurate test than your feeling), you
will find that it is exactly the same.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But if they are of the same temperature, why should the one feel
colder than the other?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The hearth and the table feel colder than the carpet or the book,
because the latter are not such good <i>conductors of heat</i> as the
former. Caloric finds a more easy passage through marble and wood, than
through leather and worsted; the two former will therefore absorb heat
more rapidly from your hand, and consequently give it a stronger
sensation of cold than the two latter, although they are all of them
really of the same temperature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>So, then, the sensation I feel on touching a cold body, is in
proportion to the rapidity with which my hand yields its heat to that
body?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
<a name = "page72" id = "page72"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Precisely; and, if you lay your hand successively on every object in
the room, you will discover which are good, and which are bad conductors
of heat, by the different degrees of cold you feel. But, in order to
ascertain this point, it is necessary that the several substances should
be of the same temperature, which will not be the case with those that
are very near the fire, or those that are exposed to a current of cold
air from a window or door.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But what is the reason that some bodies are better conductors of heat
than others?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This is a point not well ascertained. It has been conjectured that a
certain union or adherence takes place between the caloric and the
particles of the body through which it passes. If this adherence be
strong, the body detains the heat, and parts with it slowly and
reluctantly; if slight, it propagates it freely and rapidly. The
conducting power of a body is therefore, inversely, as its tendency to
unite with caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That is to say, that the best conductors are those that have the
least affinity for caloric.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
<a name = "page73" id = "page73"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but the term affinity is objectionable in this case, because, as
that word is used to express a chemical attraction (which can be
destroyed only by decomposition), it cannot be applicable to the slight
and transient union that takes place between free caloric and the bodies
through which it passes; an union which is so weak, that it constantly
yields to the tendency which caloric has to an equilibrium. Now you
clearly understand, that the passage of caloric, through bodies that are
good conductors, is much more rapid than through those that are bad
conductors, and that the former both give and receive it more quickly,
and therefore, in a given time, more abundantly, than bad conductors,
which makes them feel either hotter or colder, though they may be, in
fact, both of the same temperature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes, I understand it now; the table, and the book lying upon it,
being really of the same temperature, would each receive, in the same
space of time, the same quantity of heat from my hand, were their
conducting powers equal; but as the table is the best conductor of the
two, it will absorb the heat from my hand more rapidly, and consequently
produce a stronger sensation of cold than the book.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<a name = "page74" id = "page74"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well, my dear; and observe, likewise, that if you were to heat
the table and the book an equal number of degrees above the temperature
of your body, the table, which before felt the colder, would now feel
the hotter of the two; for, as in the first case it took the heat most
rapidly from your hand, so it will now impart heat most rapidly to it.
Thus the marble table, which seems to us colder than the mahogany one,
will prove the hotter of the two to the ice; for, if it takes heat more
rapidly from our hands, which are warmer, it will give out heat more
rapidly to the ice, which is colder. Do you understand the reason of
these apparently opposite effects?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Perfectly. A body which is a good conductor of caloric, affords it a
free passage; so that it penetrates through that body more rapidly than
through one which is a bad conductor; and consequently, if it is colder
than your hand, you lose more caloric, and if it is hotter, you gain
more than with a bad conductor of the same temperature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But you must observe that this is the case only when the conductors
are either hotter or colder than your hand; for, if you heat different
conductors
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<a name = "page75" id = "page75"> </a>
to the temperature of your body, they will all feel equally warm, since
the exchange of caloric between bodies of the same temperature is equal.
Now, can you tell me why flannel clothing, which is a very bad conductor
of heat, prevents our feeling cold?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It prevents the cold from penetrating&nbsp;.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But you forget that cold is only a negative quality.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>True; it only prevents the heat of our bodies from escaping so
rapidly as it would otherwise&nbsp;do.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Now you have explained it right; the flannel rather keeps in the
heat, than keeps out the cold. Were the atmosphere of a higher
temperature than our bodies, it would be equally efficacious in keeping
their temperature at the same degree, as it would prevent the free
access of the external heat, by the difficulty with which it
conducts&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This, I think, is very clear. Heat, whether external or internal,
cannot easily penetrate flannel;
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<a name = "page76" id = "page76"> </a>
therefore in cold weather it keeps us warm; and if the weather was
hotter than our bodies, it would keep us cool.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The most dense bodies are, generally speaking, the best conductors of
heat; probably because the denser the body the greater are the number of
points or particles that come in contact with caloric. At the common
temperature of the atmosphere a piece of metal will feel much colder
than a piece of wood, and the latter than a piece of woollen cloth; this
again will feel colder than flannel; and down, which is one of the
lightest, is at the same time one of the warmest bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This is, I suppose, the reason that the plumage of birds preserves
them so effectually from the influence of cold in winter?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but though feathers in general are an excellent preservative
against cold, down is a kind of plumage peculiar to aquatic birds, and
covers their chest, which is the part most exposed to the water; for
though the surface of the water is not of a lower temperature than the
atmosphere, yet, as it is a better conductor of heat, it feels much
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<a name = "page77" id = "page77"> </a>
colder, consequently the chest of the bird requires a warmer covering
than any other part of its body. Besides, the breasts of aquatic birds
are exposed to cold not only from the temperature of the water, but also
from the velocity with which the breast of the bird strikes against it;
and likewise from the rapid evaporation occasioned in that part by the
air against which it strikes, after it has been moistened by dipping
from time to time into the water.</p>

<p>If you hold a finger of one hand motionless in a glass of water, and
at the same time move a finger of the other hand swiftly through water
of the same temperature, a&nbsp;different sensation will be soon
perceived in the different fingers.</p>

<p>Most animal substances, especially those which Providence has
assigned as a covering for animals, such as fur, wool, hair, skin,
&amp;c. are bad conductors of heat, and are, on that account, such
excellent preservatives against the inclemency of winter, that our
warmest apparel is made of these materials.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Wood is, I dare say, not so good a conductor as metal, and it is for
that reason, no doubt, that silver teapots have always wooden
handles.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; and it is the facility with which metals
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
<a name = "page78" id = "page78"> </a>
conduct caloric that made you suppose that a silver pot radiated more
caloric than an earthen one. The silver pot is in fact hotter to the
hand when in contact with it; but it is because its conducting power
more than counterbalances its deficiency in regard to radiation.</p>

<p>We have observed that the most dense bodies are in general the best
conductors; and metals, you know, are of that class. Porous bodies, such
as the earths and wood, are worse conductors, chiefly, I&nbsp;believe,
on account of their pores being filled with air; for air is a remarkably
bad conductor.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is a very fortunate circumstance that air should be a bad
conductor, as it tends to preserve the heat of the body when exposed to
cold weather.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is one of the many benevolent dispensations of Providence, in
order to soften the inclemency of the seasons, and to render almost all
climates habitable to man.</p>

<p>In fluids of different densities, the power of conducting heat varies
no less remarkably; if you dip your hand into this vessel full of
mercury, you will scarcely conceive that its temperature is not lower
than that of the atmosphere.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<a name = "page79" id = "page79"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Indeed I know not how to believe it, it feels so extremely
cold.&mdash;But we may easily ascertain its true temperature by the
thermometer.&mdash;It is really not colder than the air;&mdash;the
apparent difference then is produced merely by the difference of the
conducting power in mercury and in air.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; hence you may judge how little the sense of feeling is to be
relied on as a test of the temperature of bodies, and how necessary a
thermometer is for that purpose.</p>

<p>It has indeed been doubted whether fluids have the power of
conducting caloric in the same manner as solid bodies. Count Rumford,
a&nbsp;very few years since, attempted to prove, by a variety of
experiments, that fluids, when at rest, were not at all endowed with
this property.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How is that possible, since they are capable of imparting cold or
heat to us; for if they did not conduct heat, they would neither take it
from, nor give it to&nbsp;us?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Count Rumford did not mean to say that fluids would not communicate
their heat to solid bodies;
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
<a name = "page80" id = "page80"> </a>
but only that heat does not pervade fluids, that is to say, is not
transmitted from one particle of a fluid to another, in the same manner
as in solid bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But when you heat a vessel of water over the fire, if the particles
of water do not communicate heat to each other, how does the water
become hot throughout?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By constant agitation. Water, as you have seen, expands by heat in
the same manner as solid bodies; the heated particles of water,
therefore, at the bottom of the vessel, become specifically lighter than
the rest of the liquid, and consequently ascend to the surface, where,
parting with some of their heat to the colder atmosphere, they are
condensed, and give way to a fresh succession of heated particles
ascending from the bottom, which having thrown off their heat at the
surface, are in their turn displaced. Thus every particle is
successively heated at the bottom, and cooled at the surface of the
liquid; but as the fire communicates heat more rapidly than the
atmosphere cools the succession of surfaces, the whole of the liquid in
time becomes heated.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This accounts most ingeniously for the propagation
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<a name = "page81" id = "page81"> </a>
of heat upwards. But suppose you were to heat the upper surface of a
liquid, the particles being specifically lighter than those below, could
not descend: how therefore would the heat be communicated downwards?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>If there were no agitation to force the heated surface downwards,
Count Rumford assures us that the heat would not descend. In proof of
this he succeeded in making the upper surface of a vessel of water boil
and evaporate, while a cake of ice remained frozen at the bottom.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That is very extraordinary indeed!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It appears so, because we are not accustomed to heat liquids by their
upper surface; but you will understand this theory better if I show you
the internal motion that takes place in liquids when they experience a
change of temperature. The motion of the liquid itself is indeed
invisible from the extreme minuteness of its particles; but if you mix
with it any coloured dust, or powder, of nearly the same specific
gravity as the liquid, you may judge of the internal motion of the
latter by that of the coloured dust it contains.&mdash;Do you see the
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
<a name = "page82" id = "page82"> </a>
small pieces of amber moving about in the liquid contained in this
phial?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes, perfectly.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We shall now immerse the phial in a glass of hot water, and the
motion of the liquid will be shown, by that which it communicates to the
amber.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I see two currents, the one rising along the sides of the phial, the
other descending in the centre: but I do not understand the reason of
this.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The hot water communicates its caloric, through the medium of the
phial, to the particles of the fluid nearest to the glass; these dilate
and ascend laterally to the surface, where, in parting with their heat,
they are condensed, and in descending, form the central current.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This is indeed a very clear and satisfactory experiment; but how much
slower the currents now move than they did at first?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is because the circulation of particles has
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
<a name = "page83" id = "page83"> </a>
nearly produced an equilibrium of temperature between the liquid in the
glass and that in the phial.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But these communicate laterally, and I thought that heat in liquids
could be propagated only upwards.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You do not take notice that the heat is imparted from one liquid to
the other, through the medium of the phial itself, the external surface
of which receives the heat from the water in the glass, whilst its
internal surface transmits it to the liquid it contains. Now take the
phial out of the hot water, and observe the effect of its cooling.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The currents are reversed; the external current now descends, and the
internal one rises.&mdash;I&nbsp;guess the reason of this
change:&mdash;the phial being in contact with cold air instead of hot
water, the external particles are cooled instead of being heated; they
therefore descend and force up the central particles, which, being
warmer, are consequently lighter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is just so. Count Rumford hence infers that no alteration of
temperature can take place in a fluid, without an internal motion of its
particles,
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<a name = "page84" id = "page84"> </a>
and as this motion is produced only by the comparative levity of the
heated particles, heat cannot be propagated downwards.</p>

<p>But though I believe that Count Rumford’s theory as to heat being
incapable of pervading fluids is not strictly correct, yet there is, no
doubt, much truth in his observation, that the communication is
materially promoted by a motion of the parts; and this accounts for the
cold that is found to prevail at the bottom of the lakes in Switzerland,
which are fed by rivers issuing from the snowy Alps. The water of these
rivers being colder, and therefore more dense than that of the lakes,
subsides to the bottom, where it cannot be affected by the warmer
temperature of the surface; the motion of the waves may communicate this
temperature to some little depth, but it can descend no further than the
agitation extends.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But when the atmosphere is colder than the lake, the colder surface
of the water will descend, for the very reason that the warmer will
not.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly: and it is on this account that neither a lake, nor any
body of water whatever, can be frozen until every particle of the water
has risen to the surface to give off its caloric to the colder
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
<a name = "page85" id = "page85"> </a>
atmosphere; therefore the deeper a body of water is, the longer will be
the time it requires to be frozen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But if the temperature of the whole body of water be brought down to
the freezing point, why is only the surface frozen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The temperature of the whole body is lowered, but not to the freezing
point. The diminution of heat, as you know, produces a contraction in
the bulk of fluids, as well as of solids. This effect, however, does not
take place in water below the temperature of 40 degrees, which is 8
degrees above the freezing point. At that temperature, therefore, the
internal motion, occasioned by the increased specific gravity of the
condensed particles, ceases; for when the water at the surface no longer
condenses, it will no longer descend, and leave a fresh surface exposed
to the atmosphere: this surface alone, therefore, will be further
exposed to its severity, and will soon be brought down to the freezing
point, when it becomes ice, which being a bad conductor of heat,
preserves the water beneath a long time from being affected by the
external cold.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And the sea does not freeze, I suppose, because
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
<a name = "page86" id = "page86"> </a>
its depth is so great, that a frost never lasts long enough to bring
down the temperature of such a great body of water to 40 degrees?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is one reason why the sea, as a large mass of water, does not
freeze. But, independently of this, salt water does not freeze till it
is cooled much below 32 degrees, and with respect to the law of
condensation, salt water is an exception, as it condenses even many
degrees below the freezing point. When the caloric of fresh water,
therefore, is imprisoned by the ice on its surface, the ocean still
continues throwing off heat into the atmosphere, which is a most signal
dispensation of Providence to moderate the intensity of the cold in
winter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This theory of the non-conducting power of liquids, does not,
I&nbsp;suppose, hold good with respect to air, otherwise the atmosphere
would not be heated by the rays of the sun passing through&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Nor is it heated in that way. The pure atmosphere is a perfectly
transparent medium, which neither radiates, absorbs, nor conducts
caloric, but transmits the rays of the sun to us without in any way
<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
<a name = "page87" id = "page87"> </a>
diminishing their intensity. The air is therefore not more heated, by
the sun’s rays passing through it, than diamond, glass, water, or any
other transparent medium.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That is very extraordinary! Are glass windows not heated then by the
sun shining on them?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; not if the glass be perfectly transparent. A&nbsp;most convincing
proof that glass transmits the rays of the sun without being heated by
them is afforded by the burning lens, which by converging the rays to a
focus will set combustible bodies on fire, without its own temperature
being raised.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yet, Mrs. B., if I hold a piece of glass near the fire it is almost
immediately warmed by it; the glass therefore must retain some of the
caloric radiated by the fire? Is it that the solar rays alone pass
freely through glass without paying tribute? It seems unaccountable that
the radiation of a common fire should have power to do what the sun’s
rays cannot accomplish.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is not because the rays from the fire have more power, but rather
because they have less, that
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
<a name = "page88" id = "page88"> </a>
they heat glass and other transparent bodies. It is true, however, that
as you approach the source of heat the rays being nearer each other, the
heat is more condensed, and can produce effects of which the solar rays,
from the great distance of their source, are incapable. Thus we should
find it impossible to roast a joint of meat by the sun’s rays, though it
is so easily done by culinary heat. Yet caloric emanated from burning
bodies, which is commonly called <i>culinary heat</i>, has neither the
intensity nor the velocity of solar rays. All caloric, we have said, is
supposed to proceed originally from the sun; but after having been
incorporated with terrestrial bodies, and again given out by them,
though its nature is not essentially altered, it retains neither the
intensity nor the velocity with which it first emanated from that
luminary; it has therefore not the power of passing through transparent
mediums, such as glass and water, without being partially retained by
those bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I recollect that in the experiment on the reflection of heat, the
glass <ins class = "correction" title = "unchanged">skreen</ins> which
you interposed between the burning taper and the mirror, arrested the
rays of caloric, and suffered only those of light to pass
through&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Glass windows, then, though they cannot be
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<a name = "page89" id = "page89"> </a>
heated by the sun shining on them, may be heated internally by a fire in
the room? But, Mrs.&nbsp;B., since the atmosphere is not warmed by the
solar rays passing through it, how does it obtain heat; for all the
fires that are burning on the surface of the earth would contribute very
little towards warming&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The radiation of heat is not confined to burning bodies: for all
bodies, you know, have that property; therefore, not only every thing
upon the surface of the earth, but the earth itself, must radiate heat;
and this terrestrial caloric, not having, I&nbsp;suppose, sufficient
power to traverse the atmosphere, communicates heat to&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Your inference is extremely well drawn, Emily; but the foundation on
which it rests is not sound; for the fact is, that terrestrial or
culinary heat, though it cannot pass through the denser transparent
mediums, such as glass or water, without loss, traverses the atmosphere
completely: so that all the heat which the earth radiates, unless it
meet with clouds or any foreign body to intercept its passage, passes
into the distant regions of the universe.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What a pity that so much heat should be wasted!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
<a name = "page90" id = "page90"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Before you are tempted to object to any law of nature, reflect
whether it may not prove to be one of the numberless dispensations of
Providence for our good. If all the heat which the earth has received
from the sun, since the creation had been accumulated in it, its
temperature by this time would, no doubt, have been more elevated than
any human being could have borne.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I spoke indeed very inconsiderately. But, Mrs.&nbsp;B., though the
earth, at such a high temperature, might have scorched our feet, we
should always have had a cool refreshing air to breathe, since the
radiation of the earth does not heat the atmosphere.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The cool air would have afforded but very insufficient refreshment,
whilst our bodies were exposed to the burning radiation of the
earth.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Nor should we have breathed a cool air; for though it is true that
heat is not communicated to the atmosphere by radiation, yet the air is
warmed by contact with heated bodies, in the same manner as solids or
liquids. The stratum of air which is immediately in contact with the
earth is heated by

<a name = "page91" id = "page91"> </a>
it; it becomes specifically lighter and rises, making way for another
stratum of air which is in its turn heated and carried upwards; and thus
each successive stratum of air is warmed by coming in contact with the
earth. You may perceive this effect in a sultry day, if you attentively
observe the strata of air near the surface of the earth; they appear in
constant agitation, for though it is true the air is itself invisible,
yet the sun shining on the vapours floating in it, render them visible,
like the amber dust in the water. The temperature of the surface of the
earth is therefore the source from whence the atmosphere derives its
heat, though it is communicated neither by radiation, nor transmitted
from one particle of it to another by the conducting power; but every
particle of air must come in contact with the earth in order to receive
heat from&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Wind then by agitating the air should contribute to cool the earth
and warm the atmosphere, by bringing a more rapid succession of fresh
strata of air in contact with the earth, and yet in general wind feels
cooler than still air?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because the agitation of the air carries off heat from the surface of
our bodies more rapidly than
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
<a name = "page92" id = "page92"> </a>
still air, by occasioning a greater number of points of contact in a
given time.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Since it is from the earth and not the sun that the atmosphere
receives its heat, I&nbsp;no longer wonder that elevated regions should
be colder than plains and valleys; it was always a subject of
astonishment to me, that in ascending a mountain and approaching the
sun, the air became colder instead of being more heated.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>At the distance of about a hundred million of miles, which we are
from the sun, the approach of a few thousand feet makes no sensible
difference, whilst it produces a very considerable effect with regard to
the warming the atmosphere at the surface of the earth.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yet as the warm air rises from the earth and the cold air descends to
it, I&nbsp;should have supposed that heat would have accumulated in the
upper regions of the atmosphere, and that we should have felt the air
warmer as we ascended?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The atmosphere, you know, diminishes in density, and consequently in
weight, as it is more distant
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
<a name = "page93" id = "page93"> </a>
from the earth; the warm air, therefore, rises only till it meets with a
stratum of air of its own density; and it will not ascend into the upper
regions of the atmosphere until all the parts beneath have been
previously heated. The length of summer even in warm climates does not
heat the air sufficiently to melt the snow which has accumulated during
the winter on very high mountains, although they are almost constantly
exposed to the heat of the sun’s rays, being too much elevated to be
often enveloped in clouds.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>These explanations are very satisfactory; but allow me to ask you one
more question respecting the increased levity of heated liquids. You
said that when water was heated over the fire, the particles at the
bottom of the vessel ascended as soon as heated, in consequence of their
specific levity: why does not the same effect continue when the water
boils, and is converted into steam? and why does the steam rise from the
surface, instead of the bottom of the liquid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The steam or vapour does ascend from the bottom, though it seems to
arise from the surface of the liquid. We shall boil some water in this
Florence flask, (<a class = "smallcaps" href = "#plateIV">Plate IV.</a>

you may be well acquainted with the process of ebullition;&mdash;you

convenient for this purpose than the chimney fire.</p>

<p>I see some small bubbles ascend, and a great many appear all over the
inside of the flask; does the water begin to boil already?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; what you now see are bubbles of air, which were either dissolved
in the water, or attached to the inner surface of the flask, and which,
being rarefied by the heat, ascend in the water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But the heat which rarefies the air inclosed in the water must rarefy
the water at the same time; therefore, if it could remain stationary in
the water when both were cold, I&nbsp;do not understand why it should
not when both are equally heated?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Air being much less dense than water, is more easily rarefied; the
former, therefore, expands to a great extent, whilst the latter
continues to occupy
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
<a name = "page95" id = "page95"> </a>
nearly the same space; for water dilates comparatively but very little
without changing its state and becoming vapour. Now that the water in
the flask begins to boil, observe what large bubbles rise from the
bottom of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I see them perfectly; but I wonder that they have sufficient power to
force themselves through the water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>They <i>must</i> rise, you know, from their specific levity.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You are right, Caroline; but vapour has not in all liquids (when
brought to the degree of vaporization) the power of overcoming the
pressure of the less heated surface. Metals, for instance, mercury
excepted, evaporate only from the surface; therefore no vapour will
ascend from them till the degree of heat which is necessary to form it
has reached the surface; that is to say, till the whole of the liquid is
brought to a state of ebullition.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I have observed that steam, immediately issuing from the spout of a
teakettle, is less visible than at a further distance from it; yet it
must be more
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<a name = "page96" id = "page96"> </a>
dense when it first evaporates, than when it begins to diffuse itself in
the air.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>When the steam is first formed, it is so perfectly dissolved by
caloric, as to be invisible. In order however to understand this, it
will be necessary for me to enter into some explanation respecting the
nature of <span class = "smallroman">SOLUTION</span>. Solution takes
place whenever a body is melted in a fluid. In this operation the body
is reduced to such a minute state of division by the fluid, as to become
invisible in it, and to partake of its fluidity; but in common solutions
this happens without any decomposition, the body being only divided into
its integrant particles by the fluid in which it is melted.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is then a mode of destroying the attraction of aggregation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly.&mdash;The two principal solvent fluids are <i>water</i>,
and <i>caloric</i>. You may have observed that if you melt salt in
water, it totally disappears, and the water remains clear, and
transparent as before; yet though the union of these two bodies appears
so perfect, it is not produced by any chemical combination; both the
salt and the water remain unchanged; and if you were to separate
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
<a name = "page97" id = "page97"> </a>
them by evaporating the latter, you would find the salt in the same
state as before.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I suppose that water is a solvent for solid bodies, and caloric for
liquids?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Liquids of course can only be converted into vapour by caloric. But
the solvent power of this agent is not at all confined to that class of
bodies; a&nbsp;great variety of solid substances are dissolved by heat:
thus metals, which are insoluble in water, can be dissolved by intense
heat, being first fused or converted into a liquid, and then rarefied
into an invisible vapour. Many other bodies, such as salt, gums, &amp;c.
yield to either of these solvents.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And that, no doubt, is the reason why hot water will melt them so
much better than cold water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is so. Caloric may, indeed, be considered as having, in every
instance, some share in the solution of a body by water, since water,
however low its temperature may be, always contains more or less
caloric.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
<a name = "page98" id = "page98"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Then, perhaps, water owes its solvent power merely to the caloric
contained in&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That, probably, would be carrying the speculation too far;
I&nbsp;should rather think that water and caloric unite their efforts to
dissolve a body, and that the difficulty or facility of effecting this,
depend both on the degree of attraction of aggregation to be overcome,
and on the arrangement of the particles which are more or less disposed
to be divided and penetrated by the solvent.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But have not all liquids the same solvent power as water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The solvent power of other liquids varies according to their nature,
and that of the substances submitted to their action. Most of these
solvents, indeed, differ essentially from water, as they do not merely
separate the integrant particles of the bodies which they dissolve, but
attack their constituent principles by the power of chemical attraction,
thus producing a true decomposition. These more complicated operations
we must consider in another place, and confine our attention
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
<a name = "page99" id = "page99"> </a>
at present to the solutions by water and caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But there are a variety of substances which, when dissolved in water,
make it thick and muddy, and destroy its transparency.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>In this case it is not a solution, but simply a mixture. I&nbsp;shall
show you the difference between a&nbsp;solution and a mixture, by
putting some common salt into one glass of water, and some powder of
chalk into another; both these substances are white, but their effect on
the water will be very different.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Very different indeed! The salt entirely disappears and leaves the
water transparent, whilst the chalk changes it into an opaque liquid
like milk.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And would lumps of chalk and salt produce similar effects on
water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, but not so rapidly; salt is, indeed, soon melted though in a
lump; but chalk, which does not mix so readily with water, would require
a
<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
<a name = "page100" id = "page100"> </a>
much greater length of time; I&nbsp;therefore preferred showing you the
experiment with both substances reduced to powder, which does not in any
respect alter their nature, but facilitates the operation merely by
presenting a greater quantity of surface to the water.</p>

<p>I must not forget to mention a very curious circumstance respecting
solutions, which is, that a fluid is not nearly so much increased in
bulk by holding a body in solution, as it would by mere mixture with the
body.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That seems impossible; for two bodies cannot exist together in the
same space.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Two bodies may, by condensation, occupy less space when in union than
when separate, and this I can show you by an easy experiment.</p>

<p>This phial, which contains some salt, I shall fill with water,
pouring it in quickly, so as not to dissolve much of the salt; and when
it is quite full I cork it.&mdash;If I now shake the phial till the salt
is dissolved, you will observe that it is no longer full.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I shall try to add a little more salt.&mdash;But now, you see,
Mrs.&nbsp;B., the water runs over.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<a name = "page101" id = "page101"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but observe that the last quantity of salt you put in remains
solid at the bottom, and displaces the water; for it has already melted
all the salt it is capable of holding in solution. This is called the
point of <i>saturation</i>; and the water in this case is said to be
<i>saturated</i> with salt.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I think I now understand the solution of a solid body by water
perfectly: but I have not so clear an idea of the solution of a liquid
by caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is probably of a similar nature; but as caloric is an invisible
fluid, its action as a solvent is not so obvious as that of water.
Caloric, we may conceive, dissolves water, and converts it into vapour
by the same process as water dissolves salt; that is to say, the
particles of water are so minutely divided by the caloric as to become
invisible. Thus, you are now enabled to understand why the vapour of
boiling water, when it first issues from the spout of a kettle, is
invisible; it is so, because it is then completely dissolved by caloric.
But the air with which it comes in contact, being much colder than the
vapour, the latter yields to it a quantity of its caloric. The particles
of vapour being thus in a great measure deprived
<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
<a name = "page102" id = "page102"> </a>
of their solvent, gradually collect, and become visible in the form of
steam, which is water in a state of imperfect solution; and if you were
further to deprive it of its caloric, it would return to its original
liquid state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That I understand very well. If you hold a cold plate over a tea-urn,
the steam issuing from it will be immediately converted into drops of
water by parting with its caloric to the plate; but in what state is the
steam, when it becomes invisible by being diffused in the air?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is not merely diffused, but is again dissolved by the air.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The air, then, has a solvent power, like water and caloric?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This was formerly believed to be the case. But it appears from more
recent enquiries that the solvent power of the atmosphere depends solely
upon the caloric contained in it. Sometimes the watery vapour diffused
in the atmosphere is but imperfectly dissolved, as is the case in the
formation of clouds and fogs; but if it gets into a region sufficiently
warm, it becomes perfectly invisible.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
<a name = "page103" id = "page103"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Can any water dissolve in the atmosphere without its being previously
converted into vapour by boiling?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Unquestionably; and this constitutes the difference between
<i>vaporization</i> and <i>evaporation</i>. Water, when heated to the
boiling point, can no longer exist in the form of water, and must
necessarily be converted into vapour or steam, whatever may be the state
and temperature of the surrounding medium; this is called vaporization.
But the atmosphere, by means of the caloric it contains, can take up a
certain portion of water at any temperature, and hold it in a state of
solution. This is simply evaporation. Thus the atmosphere is continually
carrying off moisture from the surface of the earth, until it is
saturated with&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That is the case, no doubt, when we feel the atmosphere damp.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>On the contrary, when the moisture is well dissolved it occasions no
humidity: it is only when in a state of imperfect solution and floating
in the atmosphere, in the form of watery vapour, that it produces
dampness. This happens more frequently
<span class = "pagenum">104</span>
<a name = "page104" id = "page104"> </a>
in winter than in summer; for the lower the temperature of the
atmosphere, the less water it can dissolve; and in reality it never
contains so much moisture as in a dry hot summer’s day.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>You astonish me! But why, then, is the air so dry in frosty weather,
when its temperature is at the lowest?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This, I conjecture, proceeds not so much from the moisture being
dissolved, as from its being frozen; is not that the case?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is; and the freezing of the watery vapour which the atmospheric
heat could not dissolve, produces what is called a hoar frost; for the
particles descend in freezing, and attach themselves to whatever they
meet with on the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>The tendency of free caloric to an equilibrium, together with its
solvent power, are likewise connected with the phenomena of rain, of
dew,&nbsp;&amp;c. When moist air of a certain temperature happens to
pass through a colder region of the atmosphere, it parts with a portion
of its heat to the surrounding air; the quantity of caloric, therefore,
which served to keep the water in a state of
<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
<a name = "page105" id = "page105"> </a>
vapour, being diminished, the watery particles approach each other, and
form themselves into drops of water, which being heavier than the
atmosphere, descend to the earth. There are also other circumstances,
and particularly the variation in the weight of the atmosphere, which
may contribute to the formation of rain. This, however, is an intricate
subject, into which we cannot more fully enter at present.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>In what manner do you account for the formation of dew?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Dew is a deposition of watery particles or minute drops from the
atmosphere, precipitated by the coolness of the evening.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This precipitation is owing, I suppose, to the cooling of the
atmosphere, which prevents its retaining so great a quantity of watery
vapour in solution as during the heat of the day.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Such was, from time immemorial, the generally received opinion
respecting the cause of dew; but it has been very recently proved by a
course of ingenious experiments of Dr. Wells, that the deposition
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<a name = "page106" id = "page106"> </a>
of dew is produced by the cooling of the surface of the earth, which he
has shown to take place previously to the cooling of the atmosphere; for
on examining the temperature of a plot of grass just before the
dew-fall, he found that <ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘is’">it</ins>
was considerably colder than the air a few feet above it,
from which the dew was shortly after precipitated.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But why should the earth cool in the evening sooner than the
atmosphere?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because it parts with its heat more readily than the air; the earth
is an excellent radiator of caloric, whilst the atmosphere does not
possess that property, at least in any sensible degree. Towards evening,
therefore, when the solar heat declines, and when after sunset it
entirely ceases, the earth rapidly cools by radiating heat towards the
skies; whilst the air has no means of parting with its heat but by
coming into contact with the cooled surface of the earth, to which it
communicates its caloric. Its solvent power being thus reduced, it is
unable to retain so large a portion of watery vapour, and deposits those
pearly drops which we call dew.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>If this be the cause of dew, we need not be apprehensive
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
<a name = "page107" id = "page107"> </a>
of receiving any injury from it; for it can be deposited only on
surfaces that are colder than the atmosphere, which is never the case
with our bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very true; yet I would not advise you for this reason to be too
confident of escaping all the ill effects which may arise from exposure
to the dew; for it may be deposited on your clothes, and chill you
afterwards by its evaporation from them. Besides, whenever the dew is
copious, there is a chill in the atmosphere which it is not always safe
to encounter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Wind, then, must promote the deposition of dew, by bringing a more
rapid succession of particles of air in contact with the earth, just as
it promotes the cooling of the earth and warming of the atmosphere
during the heat of the day?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; provided the wind be unattended with clouds, for these
accumulations of moisture not only prevent the free radiation of the
earth towards the upper regions, but themselves radiate towards the
earth; under these circumstances much less dew is formed than on fine
clear nights, when the radiation of the earth passes without obstacle
through the atmosphere to the distant regions of space, whence it
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<a name = "page108" id = "page108"> </a>
receives no caloric in exchange. The dew continues to be deposited
during the night, and is generally most abundant towards morning, when
the contrast between the temperature of the earth and that of the air is
greatest. After sunrise the equilibrium of temperature between these two
bodies is gradually restored by the solar rays passing freely through
the atmosphere to the earth; and later in the morning the temperature of
the earth gains the ascendency, and gives out caloric to the air by
contact, in the same manner as it receives it from the air during the
night.&mdash;Can you tell me, now, why a bottle of wine taken fresh from
the cellar (in summer particularly), will soon be covered with dew; and
even the glasses into which the wine is poured will be moistened with a
similar vapour?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The bottle being colder than the surrounding air, must absorb caloric
from it; the moisture therefore which that air contained becomes
visible, and forms the dew which is deposited on the bottle.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well, Emily. Now, Caroline, can you inform me why, in a warm
room, or close carriage, the contrary effect takes place; that is to
say, that the inside of the windows is covered with vapour?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
<a name = "page109" id = "page109"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I have heard that it proceeds from the breath of those within the
room or the carriage; and I suppose it is occasioned by the windows
which, being colder than the breath, deprive it of part of its caloric,
and by this means convert it into watery vapour.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You have both explained it extremely well. Bodies attract dew in
proportion as they are good radiators of caloric, as it is this quality
which reduces their temperature below that of the atmosphere; hence we
find that little or no dew is deposited on rocks, sand, water; while
grass and living vegetables, to which it is so highly beneficial,
attract it in abundance&mdash;another remarkable instance of the wise
and bountiful dispensations of Providence.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And we may again observe it in the abundance of dew in summer, and in
hot climates, when its cooling effects are so much required; but I do
not understand what natural cause increases the dew in hot weather?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The more caloric the earth receives during the day, the more it will
radiate afterwards, and consequently the more rapidly its temperature
will be reduced in the evening, in comparison to that of the
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
<a name = "page110" id = "page110"> </a>
atmosphere. In the West-Indies especially, where the intense heat of the
day is strongly contrasted with the coolness of the evening, the dew is
prodigiously abundant. During a drought, the dew is less plentiful, as
the earth is not sufficiently supplied with moisture to be able to
saturate the atmosphere.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I have often observed, Mrs. B., that when I walk out in frosty
weather, with a veil over my face, my breath freezes upon it. Pray what
is the reason of that?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is because the cold air immediately seizes on the caloric of your
breath, and, by robbing it of its solvent, reduces it to a denser fluid,
which is the watery vapour that settles on your veil, and there it
continues parting with its caloric till it is brought down to the
temperature of the atmosphere, and assumes the form of ice.</p>

<p>You may, perhaps, have observed that the breath of animals, or rather
the moisture contained in it, is visible in damp weather, or during a
frost. In the former case, the atmosphere being over-saturated with
moisture, can dissolve no more. In the latter, the cold condenses it
into visible vapour; and for the same reason, the steam arising from
water that is warmer than the atmosphere,
<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
<a name = "page111" id = "page111"> </a>
becomes visible. Have you never taken notice of the vapour rising from
your hands after having dipped them into warm water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Frequently, especially in frosty weather.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We have already observed that pressure is an obstacle to evaporation:
there are liquids that contain so great a quantity of caloric, and whose
particles consequently adhere so slightly together, that they may be
rapidly converted into vapour without any elevation of temperature,
merely by taking off the weight of the atmosphere. In such liquids, you
perceive, it is the pressure of the atmosphere alone that connects their
particles, and keeps them in a liquid state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I do not well understand why the particles of such fluids should be
disunited and converted into vapour, without any elevation of
temperature, in spite of the attraction of cohesion.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is because the degree of heat at which we usually observe these
fluids is sufficient to overcome their attraction of cohesion. Ether is
of this description;
<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
<a name = "page112" id = "page112"> </a>
it will boil and be converted into vapour, at the common temperature of
the air, if the pressure of the atmosphere be taken off.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I thought that ether would evaporate without either the pressure of
the atmosphere being taken away, or heat applied; and that it was for
that reason so necessary to keep it carefully corked&nbsp;up?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is true it will evaporate, but without ebullition; what I am now
speaking of is the vaporization of ether, or its conversion into vapour
by boiling. I&nbsp;am going to show you how suddenly the ether in this
phial will be converted into vapour, by means of the
air-pump.&mdash;Observe with what rapidity the bubbles ascend, as I take
off the pressure of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It positively boils: how singular to see a liquid boil without
heat!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Now I shall place the phial of ether in this glass, which it nearly
fits, so as to leave only a small space, which I fill with water; and in
this state I put it again under the receiver.

<p>It is indeed wonderful to see water freeze in contact with a boiling
fluid!</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I am at a loss to conceive how the ether can pass to the state of
vapour without an addition of caloric. Does it not contain more caloric
in a state of vapour, than in a state of liquidity?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It certainly does; for though it is the pressure of the atmosphere
which condenses it into a liquid, it is by forcing out the caloric that
belongs to it when in an aëriform state.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
<a name = "page114" id = "page114"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>You have, therefore, two difficulties to explain,
Mrs.&nbsp;B.&mdash;First, from whence the ether obtains the caloric
necessary to convert it into vapour when it is relieved from the
pressure of the atmosphere; and, secondly, what is the reason that the
water, in which the bottle of ether stands, is frozen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Now, I&nbsp;think, I can answer both these questions. The ether
obtains the addition of caloric required, from the water in the glass;
and the loss of caloric, which the latter sustains, is the occasion of
its freezing.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You are perfectly right; and if you look at the thermometer which I
have placed in the water, whilst I am working the pump, you will see
that every time bubbles of vapour are produced, the mercury descends;
which proves that the heat of the water diminishes in proportion as the
ether boils.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This I understand now very well; but if the water freezes in
consequence of yielding its caloric to the ether, the equilibrium of
heat must, in this case, be totally destroyed. Yet you have told us,
that the exchange of caloric between two bodies of
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
<a name = "page115" id = "page115"> </a>
equal temperature, was always equal; how, then, is it that the water,
which was originally of the same temperature as the ether, gives out
caloric to it, till the water is frozen, and the ether made to boil?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I suspected that you would make these objections; and, in order to
remove them, I&nbsp;enclosed two thermometers in the air-pump; one which
stands in the glass of water, the other in the phial of ether; and you
may see that the equilibrium of temperature is not destroyed; for as the
thermometer descends in the water, that in the ether sinks in the same
manner; so that both thermometers indicate the same temperature, though
one of them is in a boiling, the other in a freezing liquid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The ether, then, becomes colder as it boils? This is so contrary to
common experience, that I confess it astonishes me exceedingly.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, a most extraordinary circumstance. But pray, how do
you account for&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I cannot satisfy your curiosity at present; for before we can attempt
to explain this apparent
<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
<a name = "page116" id = "page116"> </a>
paradox, it is necessary to become acquainted with the subject of <span
class = "smallroman">LATENT HEAT</span>: and that, I&nbsp;think, we must
defer till our next interview.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I believe, Mrs. B., that you are glad to put off the explanation; for
it must be a very difficult point to account for.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I hope, however, that I shall do it to your complete
satisfaction.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But before we part, give me leave to ask you one question. Would not
water, as well as ether, boil with less heat, if deprived of the
pressure of the atmosphere?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly. You must always recollect that there are two forces to
overcome, in order to make a liquid boil or evaporate; the attraction of
aggregation, and the weight of the atmosphere. On the summit of a high
mountain (as Mr. De Saussure ascertained on Mount Blanc) much less heat
is required to make water boil, than in the plain, where the weight of
the atmosphere is
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
<a name = "page117" id = "page117"> </a>
greater.<a class = "tag" name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href = "#note8">*</a>
Indeed if the weight of the atmosphere be entirely removed by means of a
good air-pump, and if water be placed in the exhausted receiver, it will
evaporate so fast, however cold it maybe, as to give it the appearance
of boiling from the surface. But without the assistance of the air-pump,
I&nbsp;can show you a very pretty experiment, which proves the effect of
the pressure of the atmosphere in this respect.</p>

<p>Observe, that this Florence flask is about half full of water, and
the upper half of invisible vapour, the water being in the act of
boiling.&mdash;I&nbsp;take it from the lamp, and cork it
carefully&mdash;the water, you see, immediately ceases
boiling.&mdash;I&nbsp;shall now dip the flask into a bason of cold
water.<a class = "tag" name = "tag9" id = "tag9" href =
"#note9">†</a></p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But look, Mrs. B., the hot water begins to boil again, although the
cold water must rob it more and more of its caloric! What can be the
reason of that?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
<a name = "page118" id = "page118"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Let us examine its temperature. You see the thermometer immersed in
it remains stationary at 180 degrees, which is about 30 degrees below
the boiling point. When I took the flask from the lamp, I&nbsp;observed
to you that the upper part of it was filled with vapour; this being
compelled to yield its caloric to the cold water, was again condensed
into water&mdash;What, then, filled the upper part of the flask?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Nothing; for it was too well corked for the air to gain admittance,
and therefore the upper part of the flask must be a vacuum.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The water below, therefore, no longer sustains the pressure of the
atmosphere, and will consequently boil at a much lower temperature.
Thus, you see, though it had lost many degrees of heat, it began boiling
again the instant the vacuum was formed above it. The boiling has now
ceased, the temperature of the water being still farther reduced; if it
had been ether, instead of water, it would have continued boiling much
longer, for ether boils, under the usual atmospheric pressure, at a
temperature as low as 100 degrees; and in a vacuum it boils at almost
any temperature; but
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
<a name = "page119" id = "page119"> </a>
water being a more dense fluid, requires a more considerable quantity of
caloric to make it evaporate quickly, even when the pressure of the
atmosphere is removed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What proportion of vapour can the atmosphere contain in a state of
solution?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I do not know whether it has been exactly ascertained by experiment;
but at any rate this proportion must vary, both according to the
temperature and the weight of the atmosphere; for the lower the
temperature, and the greater the pressure, the smaller must be the
proportion of vapour that the atmosphere can contain.</p>

<p>To conclude the subject of free caloric, I&nbsp;should mention
<i>Ignition</i>, by which is meant that emission of light which is
produced in bodies at a very high temperature, and which is the effect
of accumulated caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>You mean, I suppose, that light which is produced by a burning
body?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No: ignition is quite independent of combustion. Clay, chalk, and
indeed all incombustible
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
<a name = "page120" id = "page120"> </a>
substances, may be made red hot. When a body burns, the light emitted is
the effect of a chemical change which takes place, whilst ignition is
the effect of caloric alone, and no other change than that of
temperature is produced in the ignited body.</p>

<p>All solid bodies, and most liquids, are susceptible of ignition, or,
in other words, of being heated so as to become luminous; and it is
remarkable that this takes place pretty nearly at the same temperature
in all bodies, that is, at about 800 degrees of Fahrenheit’s scale.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But how can liquids attain so high a temperature, without being
converted into vapour?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By means of confinement and pressure. Water confined in a strong iron
vessel (called Papin’s digester) can have its temperature raised to
upwards of 400 degrees. Sir James Hall has made some very curious
experiments on the effects of heat assisted by pressure; by means of
strong gun-barrels, he succeeded in melting a variety of substances
which were considered as infusible: and it is not unlikely that, by
similar methods, water itself might be heated to redness.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">121</span>
<a name = "page121" id = "page121"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I am surprised at that: for I thought that the force of steam was
such as to destroy almost all mechanical resistance.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The expansive force of steam is prodigious; but in order to subject
water to such high temperatures, it is prevented by confinement from
being converted into steam, and the expansion of heated water is
comparatively trifling.&mdash;But we have dwelt so long on the subject
of free caloric, that we must reserve the other modifications of that
agent to our next meeting, when we shall endeavour to proceed more
rapidly.</p>

Two pieces of thin glass tubes, sealed at one end, might answer this
purpose better. The experiment, however, as here described, is
difficult, and requires a very nice apparatus. But if, instead of phials
or tubes, two watch-glasses be used, water may be frozen almost
instantly in the same manner. The two glasses are placed over one
another, with a few drops of water interposed between them, and the
uppermost glass is filled with ether. After working the pump for a
minute or two, the glasses are found to adhere strongly together, and a
thin layer of ice is seen between them.</p>

modifications of caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I am very curious to know of what nature they can be; for I have no
notion of any kind of heat that is not perceptible to the senses.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>In order to enable you to understand them, it will be necessary to
enter into some previous explanations.</p>

<p>It has been discovered by modern chemists, that bodies of a different
nature, heated to the same temperature, do not contain the same quantity
of caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How could that be ascertained? Have you not told us that it is
impossible to discover the absolute quantity of caloric which bodies
contain?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
<a name = "page123" id = "page123"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>True; but at the same time I said that we were enabled to form a
judgment of the proportions which bodies bore to each other in this
respect. Thus it is found that, in order to raise the temperature of
different bodies the same number of degrees, different quantities of
caloric are required for each of them. If, for instance, you place a
pound of lead, a&nbsp;pound of chalk, and a pound of milk, in a hot
oven, they will be gradually heated to the temperature of the oven; but
the lead will attain it first, the chalk next, and the milk last.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That is a natural consequence of their different bulks; the lead
being the smallest body, will be heated soonest, and the milk, which is
the largest, will require the longest time.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That explanation will not do, for if the lead be the least in bulk,
it offers also the least surface to the caloric, the quantity of heat
therefore which can enter into it in the same space of time is
proportionally smaller.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Why, then, do not the three bodies attain the temperature of the oven
at the same time?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
<a name = "page124" id = "page124"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is supposed to be on account of the different capacity of these
bodies for caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What do you mean by the capacity of a body for caloric?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I mean a certain disposition of bodies to require more or less
caloric for raising their temperature to any degree of heat. Perhaps the
fact may be thus explained:</p>

<p>Let us put as many marbles into this glass as it will contain, and
pour some sand over them&mdash;observe how the sand penetrates and
lodges between them. We shall now fill another glass with pebbles of
various forms&mdash;you see that they arrange themselves in a more
compact manner than the marbles, which, being globular, can touch each
other by a single point only. The pebbles, therefore, will not admit so
much sand between them; and consequently one of these glasses will
necessarily contain more sand than the other, though both of them be
equally full.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This I understand perfectly. The marbles and the pebbles represent
two bodies of different kinds, and the sand the caloric contained in
them;
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<a name = "page125" id = "page125"> </a>
it appears very plain, from this comparison, that one body may admit of
more caloric between its particles than another.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You can no longer be surprised, therefore, that bodies of a different
capacity for caloric should require different proportions of that fluid
to raise their temperatures equally.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But I do not conceive why the body that contains the most caloric
should not be of the highest temperature; that is to say, feel hot in
proportion to the quantity of caloric it contains?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The caloric that is employed in filling the capacity of a body, is
not free caloric; but is imprisoned as it were in the body, and is
therefore imperceptible: for we can feel only the caloric which the body
parts with, and not that which it retains.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It appears to me very extraordinary that heat should be confined in a
body in such a manner as to be imperceptible.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
<a name = "page126" id = "page126"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>If you lay your hand on a hot body, you feel only the caloric which
leaves it, and enters your hand; for it is impossible that you should be
sensible of that which remains in the body. The thermometer, in the same
manner, is affected only by the free caloric which a body transmits to
it, and not at all by that which it does not part with.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I begin to understand it: but I confess that the idea of insensible
heat is so new and strange to me, that it requires some time to render
it familiar.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Call it insensible caloric, and the difficulty will appear much less
formidable. It is indeed a sort of contradiction to call it heat, when
it is so situated as to be incapable of producing that sensation. Yet
this modification of caloric is commonly called <span class =
"smallroman">SPECIFIC HEAT</span>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But it certainly would have been more correct to have called it
<i>specific caloric</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I do not understand how the term <i>specific</i> applies to this
modification of caloric?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
<a name = "page127" id = "page127"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It expresses the relative quantity of caloric which different
<i>species</i> of bodies of the same weight and temperature are capable
of containing. This modification is also frequently called <i>heat of
capacity</i>, a&nbsp;term perhaps preferable, as it explains better its
own meaning.</p>

<p>You now understand, I suppose, why the milk and chalk required a
longer portion of time than the lead to raise their temperature to that
of the oven?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes: the milk and chalk having a greater capacity for caloric than
the lead, a&nbsp;greater proportion of that fluid became insensible in
those bodies: and the more slowly, therefore, their temperature was
raised.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But might not this difference proceed from the different conducting
powers of heat in these three bodies, since that which is the best
conductor must necessarily attain the temperature of the oven first?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well observed, Caroline. This objection would be insurmountable,
if we could not, by reversing the experiment, prove that the milk, the
chalk, and the lead, actually absorbed different
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
<a name = "page128" id = "page128"> </a>
quantities of caloric, and we know that if the different time they took
in heating, proceeded merely from their different conducting powers,
they would each have acquired an equal quantity of caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Certainly. But how can you reverse this <ins class = "mycorr" title =
"text reads ‘expe-/periment’ at line break">experiment</ins>?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It may be done by cooling the several bodies to the same degree in an
apparatus adapted to receive and measure the caloric which they give
out. Thus, if you plunge them into three equal quantities of water, each
at the same temperature, you will be able to judge of the relative
quantity of caloric which the three bodies contained, by that, which, in
cooling, they communicated to their respective portions of water: for
the same quantity of caloric which they each absorbed to raise their
temperature, will abandon them in lowering it; and on examining the
three vessels of water, you will find the one in which you immersed the
lead to be the least heated; that which held the chalk will be the next;
and that which contained the milk will be heated the most of all. The
celebrated Lavoisier has invented a machine to estimate, upon this
principle, the specific heat of bodies in a more perfect manner; but I
cannot
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
<a name = "page129" id = "page129"> </a>
explain it to you, till you are acquainted with the next modification of
caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The more dense a body is, I suppose, the less is its capacity for
caloric?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This is not always the case with bodies of different nature; iron,
for instance, contains more specific heat than tin, though it is more
dense. This seems to show that specific heat does hot merely depend upon
the interstices between the particles; but, probably, also upon some
peculiar constitution of the bodies which we do not comprehend.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But, Mrs. B., it would appear to me more proper to compare bodies by
<i>measure</i>, rather than by <i>weight</i>, in order to estimate their
specific heat. Why, for instance, should we not compare <i>pints</i> of
milk, of chalk, and of lead, rather than <i>pounds</i> of those
substances; for equal weights may be composed of very different
quantities?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You are mistaken, my dear; equal weight must contain equal quantities
of matter; and when we wish to know what is the relative quantity of
caloric,
<span class = "pagenum">130</span>
<a name = "page130" id = "page130"> </a>
which substances of various kinds are capable of containing under the
same temperature, we must compare equal weights, and not equal bulks of
those substances. Bodies of the same weight may undoubtedly be of very
different dimensions; but that does not change their real quantity of
matter. A&nbsp;pound of feathers does not contain one atom more than a
pound of lead.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I have another difficulty to propose. It appears to me, that if the
temperature of the three bodies in the oven did not rise equally, they
would never reach the same degree; the lead would always keep its
advantage over the chalk and milk, and would perhaps be boiling before
the others had attained the temperature of the oven. I&nbsp;think you
might as well say that, in the course of time, you and I should be of
the same age?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Your comparison is not correct, Caroline. As soon as the lead reached
the temperature of the oven, it would remain stationary; for it would
then give out as much heat as it would receive. You should recollect
that the exchange of radiating heat, between two bodies of equal
temperature, is equal: it would be impossible, therefore, for the lead
to accumulate heat after having attained
<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
<a name = "page131" id = "page131"> </a>
the temperature of the oven; and that of the chalk and milk therefore
would ultimately arrive at the same standard. Now I fear that this will
not hold good with respect to our ages, and that, as long as I live,
I&nbsp;shall never cease to keep my advantage over you.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I think that I have found a comparison for specific heat, which is
very applicable. Suppose that two men of equal weight and bulk, but who
required different quantities of food to satisfy their appetites, sit
down to dinner, both equally hungry; the one would consume a much
greater quantity of provisions than the other, in order to be equally
satisfied.</p>

<p>Yes, that is very fair; for the quantity of food necessary to satisfy
their respective appetites, varies in the same manner as the quantity of
caloric requisite to raise equally the temperature of different
bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The thermometer, then, affords no indication of the specific heat of
bodies?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>None at all: no more than satiety is a test of the quantity of food
eaten. The thermometer, as
<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
<a name = "page132" id = "page132"> </a>
I have repeatedly said, can be affected only by free caloric, which
alone raises the temperature of bodies.</p>

<p>But there is another mode of proving the existence of specific heat,
which affords a very satisfactory illustration of that modification.
This, however, I&nbsp;did not enlarge upon before, as I thought it might
appear to you rather complicated.&mdash;If you mix two fluids of
different temperatures, let us say the one at 50 degrees, and the other
at 100 degrees, of what temperature do you suppose the mixture
will&nbsp;be?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It will be no doubt the medium between the two, that is to say, 75
degrees.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That will be the case if the two bodies happen to have the same
capacity for caloric; but if not, a&nbsp;different result will be
obtained. Thus, for instance, if you mix together a pound of mercury,
heated at 50 degrees, and a pound of water heated at 100 degrees, the
temperature of the mixture, instead of being 75 degrees, will be <ins
class = "mycorr" title = "error for 88?">80</ins> degrees; so that the
water will have lost only 12 degrees, whilst the mercury will have
gained 38 degrees; from which you will conclude that the capacity of
mercury for heat is less than that of water.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
<a name = "page133" id = "page133"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I wonder that mercury should have so little specific heat. Did we not
see it was a much better conductor of heat than water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And it is precisely on that account that its specific heat is less.
For since the conductive power of bodies depends, as we have observed
before, on their readiness to receive heat and part with it, it is
natural to expect that those bodies which are the worst conductors
should absorb the most caloric before they are disposed to part with it
to other bodies. But let us now proceed to <span class =
"smallroman">LATENT HEAT</span>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And pray what kind of heat is that?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is another modification of combined caloric, which is so analogous
to specific heat, that most chemists make no distinction between them;
but Mr. Pictet, in his Essay on Fire, has so clearly discriminated them,
that I am induced to adopt his view of the subject. We therefore call
<i>latent heat</i> that portion of insensible caloric which is employed
in changing the state of bodies; that is to say, in converting solids
into liquids, or liquids; into vapour. When a body changes its state
from
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
<a name = "page134" id = "page134"> </a>
solid to liquid, or from liquid to vapour, its expansion occasions a
sudden and considerable increase of capacity for heat, in consequence of
which it immediately absorbs a quantity of caloric, which becomes fixed
in the body which it has transformed; and, as it is perfectly concealed
from our senses, it has obtained the name of <i>latent</i> heat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I think it would be much more correct to call this modification
latent caloric instead of latent heat, since it does not excite the
sensation of heat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This modification of heat was discovered and named by Dr. Black long
before the French chemists introduced the term caloric, and we must not
presume to alter it, as it is still used by much better chemists than
ourselves. And, besides, you are not to suppose that the nature of heat
is altered by being variously modified: for if latent heat and specific
heat do not excite the same sensations as free caloric, it is owing to
their being in a state of confinement, which prevents them from acting
upon our organs; and consequently, as soon as they are extricated from
the body in which they are imprisoned, they return to their state of
free caloric.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
<a name = "page135" id = "page135"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But I do not yet clearly see in what respect latent heat differs from
specific heat; for they are both of them imprisoned and concealed in
bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Specific heat is that which is employed in filling the capacity of a
body for caloric, in the state in which this body actually exists; while
latent heat is that which is employed only in effecting a change of
state, that is, in converting bodies from a solid to a liquid, or from a
liquid to an aëriform state. But I think that, in a general point of
view, both these modifications might be comprehended under the name of
<i>heat of capacity</i>, as in both cases the caloric is equally engaged
in filling the capacities of bodies.</p>

<p>I shall now show you an experiment, which I hope will give you a
clear idea of what is understood by latent heat.</p>

<p>The snow which you see in this phial has been cooled by certain
chemical means (which I cannot well explain to you at present), to 5 or
6 degrees below the freezing point, as you will find indicated by the
thermometer which is placed in it. We shall expose it to the heat of a
lamp, and you will see the thermometer gradually rise, till it reaches
the freezing point&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
<a name = "page136" id = "page136"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But there it stops, Mrs. B., and yet the lamp burns just as well as
before. Why is not its heat communicated to the thermometer?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And the snow begins to melt, therefore it must be rising above the
freezing point?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The heat no longer affects the thermometer, because it is wholly
employed in converting the ice into water. As the ice melts, the caloric
becomes <i>latent</i> in the new-formed liquid, and therefore cannot
raise its temperature; and the thermometer will consequently remain
stationary, till the whole of the ice be melted.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Now it is all melted, and the thermometer begins to rise again.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because the conversion of the ice into water being completed, the
caloric no longer becomes latent; and therefore the heat which the water
now receives raises its temperature, as you find the thermometer
indicates.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<a name = "page137" id = "page137"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But I do not think that the thermometer rises so quickly in the water
as it did in the ice, previous to its beginning to melt, though the lamp
burns equally well?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is owing to the different specific heat of ice and water. The
capacity of water for caloric being greater than that of ice, more heat
is required to raise its temperature, and therefore the thermometer
rises slower in the water than in the ice.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>True; you said that a solid body always increased its capacity for
heat by becoming fluid; and this is an instance of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, and the latent heat is that which is absorbed in consequence of
the greater capacity which the water has for heat, in comparison to
ice.</p>

<p>I must now tell you a curious calculation founded on that
consideration. I&nbsp;have before observed to you that though the
thermometer shows us the comparative warmth of bodies, and enables us to
determine the same point at different times and places, it gives us no
idea of the absolute quantity of heat in any body. We cannot tell how
low it ought to fall by the privation of all heat, but an
<span class = "pagenum">138</span>
<a name = "page138" id = "page138"> </a>
attempt has been made to infer it in the following manner. It has been
found by experiment, that the capacity of water for heat, when compared
with that of ice, is as 10 to 9, so that, at the same temperature, ice
contains one tenth of caloric less than water. By experiment also it is
observed, that in order to melt ice, there must be added to it as much
heat, as would, if it did not melt it, raise its temperature 140
degrees. This quantity of heat is therefore absorbed when the ice, by
being converted into water, is made to contain one-ninth more caloric
than it did before. Therefore 140 degrees is a ninth part of the heat
contained in ice at 30 degrees; and the point of zero, or the absolute
privation of heat, must consequently be 1260 degrees below 32
degrees.</p>

<p>This mode of investigating so curious a question is ingenious, but
its correctness is not yet established by similar calculations for other
bodies. The points of absolute cold, indicated by this method in various
bodies, are very remote from each other; it is however possible, that
this may arise from some imperfection in the experiments.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is indeed very ingenious&mdash;but we must now attend to our
present experiment. The water begins to boil, and the thermometer is
again stationary.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
<a name = "page139" id = "page139"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Well, Caroline, it is your turn to explain the phenomenon.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is wonderfully curious! The caloric is now busy in changing the
water into steam, in which it hides itself, and becomes insensible. This
is another example of latent heat, producing a change of form. At first
it converted a solid body into a liquid, and now it turns the liquid
into vapour!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You see, my dear, how easily you have become acquainted with these
modifications of insensible heat, which at first appeared so
unintelligible. If, now, we were to reverse these changes, and condense
the vapour into water, and the water into ice, the latent heat would
re-appear entirely, in the form of free caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray do let us see the effect of latent heat returning to its free
state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>For the purpose of showing this, we need simply conduct the vapour
through this tube into this vessel of cold water, where it will part
with its latent heat and return to its liquid form.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
<a name = "page140" id = "page140"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>How rapidly the steam heats the water!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is because it does not merely impart its free caloric to the
water, but likewise its latent heat. This method of heating liquids, has
been turned to advantage, in several economical establishments. The
steam-kitchens, which are getting into such general use, are upon the
same principle. The steam is conveyed through a pipe in a similar
manner, into the several vessels which contain the provisions to be
dressed, where it communicates to them its latent caloric, and returns
to the state of water. Count Rumford makes great use of this principle
in many of his fire-places: his grand maxim is to avoid all unnecessary
waste of caloric, for which purpose he confines the heat in such a
manner, that not a particle of it shall unnecessarily escape; and while
he economises the free caloric, he takes care also to turn the latent
heat to advantage. It is thus that he is enabled to produce a degree of
heat superior to that which is obtained in common fire-places, though he
employs less fuel.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>When the advantages of such contrivances are so clear and plain,
I&nbsp;cannot understand why they are not universally used.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
<a name = "page141" id = "page141"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>A long time is always required before innovations, however useful,
can be reconciled with the prejudices of the vulgar.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What a pity it is that there should be a prejudice against new
inventions; how much more rapidly the world would improve, if such
useful discoveries were immediately and universally adopted!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I believe, my dear, that there are as many novelties attempted to be
introduced, the adoption of which would be prejudicial to society, as
there are of those which would be beneficial to it. The well-informed,
though by no means exempt from error, have an unquestionable advantage
over the illiterate, in judging what is likely or not to prove
serviceable; and therefore we find the former more ready to adopt such
discoveries as promise to be really advantageous, than the latter, who
having no other test of the value of a novelty but time and experience,
at first oppose its introduction. The well-informed, however, are
frequently disappointed in their most sanguine expectations, and the
prejudices of the vulgar, though they often retard the progress of
knowledge, yet sometimes, it must be
<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
<a name = "page142" id = "page142"> </a>
admitted, prevent the propagation of error.&mdash;But we are deviating
from our subject.</p>

<p>We have converted steam into water, and are now to change water into
ice, in order to render the latent heat sensible, as it escapes from the
water on its becoming solid. For this purpose we must produce a degree
of cold that will make water freeze.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That must be very difficult to accomplish in this warm room.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not so much as you think. There are certain chemical mixtures which
produce a rapid change from the solid to the fluid state, or the
reverse, in the substances combined, in consequence of which change
latent heat is either extricated or absorbed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I do not quite understand you.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This snow and salt, which you see me mix together, are melting
rapidly; heat, therefore, must be absorbed by the mixture, and cold
produced.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It feels even colder than ice, and yet the snow is melted. This is
very extraordinary.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
<a name = "page143" id = "page143"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The cause of the intense cold of the mixture is to be attributed to
the change from a solid to a fluid state. The union of the snow and salt
produces a new arrangement of their particles, in consequence of which
they become liquid; and the quantity of caloric, required to effect this
change, is seized upon by the mixture wherever it can be obtained. This
eagerness of the mixture for caloric, during its liquefaction, is such,
that it converts part of its own free caloric into latent heat, and it
is thus that its temperature is lowered.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Whatever you put in this mixture, therefore, would freeze?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; at least any fluid that is susceptible of freezing at that
temperature. I&nbsp;have prepared this mixture of salt and snow for the
purpose of freezing the water from which you are desirous of seeing the
latent heat escape. I&nbsp;have put a thermometer in the glass of water
that is to be frozen, in order that you may see how it cools.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The thermometer descends, but the heat which the water is now losing,
is its <i>free</i>, not its <i>latent</i> heat.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">144</span>
<a name = "page144" id = "page144"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly; it does not part with its latent heat till it changes its
state and is converted into ice.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But here is a very extraordinary circumstance! The thermometer is
fallen below the freezing point, and yet the water is not frozen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is always the case previous to the freezing of water when it is
in a state of rest. Now it begins to congeal, and you may observe that
the thermometer again rises to the freezing point.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It appears to me very strange that the thermometer should rise the
very moment that the water freezes; for it seems to imply that the water
was colder before it froze than when in the act of freezing.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is so; and after our long dissertation on this circumstance,
I&nbsp;did not think it would appear so surprising to you. Reflect a
little, and I think you will discover the reason of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It must be, no doubt, the extrications of latent heat, at the instant
the water freezes, that raises the temperature.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">145</span>
<a name = "page145" id = "page145"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly; and if you now examine the thermometer, you will find that
its rise was but temporary, and lasted only during the disengagement of
the latent heat&mdash;now that all the water is frozen it falls again,
and will continue to fall till the ice and mixture are of an equal
temperature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And can you show us any experiments in which liquids, by being mixed,
become solid, and disengage latent heat?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I could show you several; but you are not yet sufficiently advanced
to understand them well. I&nbsp;shall, however, try one, which will
afford you a striking instance of the fact. The fluid which you see in
this phial consists of a quantity of a certain salt called <i>muriat of
lime</i>, dissolved in water. Now, if I pour into it a few drops of this
other fluid, called <i>sulphuric acid</i>, the whole, or very nearly the
whole, will be instantaneously converted into a solid mass.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>How white it turns! I feel the latent heat escaping, for the bottle
is warm, and the fluid is changed to a solid white substance like
chalk!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
<a name = "page146" id = "page146"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This is, indeed, the most curious experiment we have seen yet. But
pray what is that white vapour that ascends from the mixture?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You are not yet enough of a chemist to understand that.&mdash;But
take care, Caroline, do not approach too near it, for it has a very
pungent smell.</p>

<p>I shall show you another instance similar to that of the water, which
you observed to become warmer as it froze. I&nbsp;have in this phial a
solution of a salt called sulphat of soda or Glauber’s salt, made very
strong, and corked up when it was hot, and kept without agitation till
it became cold, as you may feel the phial is. Now when I take out the
cork and let the air fall upon it, (for being closed when boiling, there
was a vacuum in the upper part) observe that the salt will suddenly
crystallize.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Surprising! how beautifully the needles of salt have shot through the
whole phial!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, it is very striking&mdash;but pray do not forget the object of
the experiment. Feel how warm the phial has become by the conversion of
part of the liquid into a solid.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">147</span>
<a name = "page147" id = "page147"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Quite warm I declare! this is a most curious experiment of the
disengagement of latent heat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The slakeing of lime is another remarkable instance of the
extrication of latent heat. Have you never observed how quick-lime
smokes when water is poured upon it, and how much heat it produces?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes; but I do not understand what change of state takes place in the
lime that occasions its giving out latent heat; for the quick-lime,
which is solid, is (if I recollect right) reduced to powder, by this
operation, and is, therefore, rather expanded than condensed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is from the water, not the lime, that the latent heat is set free.
The water incorporates with, and becomes solid in the lime; in
consequence of which, the heat, which kept it in a liquid state, is
disengaged, and escapes in a sensible form.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I always thought that the heat originated in the lime. It seems very
strange that water, and cold water too, should contain so much heat.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">148</span>
<a name = "page148" id = "page148"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>After this extrication of caloric, the water must exist in a state of
ice in the lime, since it parts with the heat which kept it liquid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It cannot properly be called ice, since ice implies a degree of cold,
at least equal to the freezing point. Yet as water, in combining with
lime, gives out more heat than in freezing, it must be in a state of
still greater solidity in the lime, than it is in the form of ice; and
you may have observed that it does not moisten or liquefy the lime in
the smallest degree.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But, Mrs. B., the smoke that rises is white; if it was only pure
caloric which escaped, we might feel, but could not see&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This white vapour is formed by some of the particles of lime, in a
state of fine dust, which are carried off by the caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>In all changes of state, then, a body either absorbs or disengages
latent heat?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">149</span>
<a name = "page149" id = "page149"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You cannot exactly say <i>absorbs latent heat</i>, as the heat
becomes latent only on being confined in the body; but you may say,
generally, that bodies, in passing from a solid to a liquid form, or
from the liquid state to that of vapour, absorb heat; and that when the
reverse takes place, heat is disengaged.<a class = "tag" name = "tag10"
id = "tag10" href = "#note10">*</a></p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>We can now, I think, account for the ether boiling, and the water
freezing in vacuo, at the same temperature.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag11" id = "tag11" href = "#note11">†</a></p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Let me hear how you explain it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The latent heat, which the water gave out in freezing, was
immediately absorbed by the ether, during its conversion into vapour;
and therefore, from a latent state in one liquid, it passed into a
latent state in the other.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But this only partly accounts for the result of the experiment; it
remains to be explained why the
<span class = "pagenum">150</span>
<a name = "page150" id = "page150"> </a>
temperature of the ether, while in a state of ebullition, is brought
down to the freezing temperature of the water.&mdash;It is because the
ether, during its evaporation, reduces its own temperature, in the same
proportion as that of the water, by converting its free caloric into
latent heat: so that, though one liquid boils, and the other freezes,
their temperatures remain in a state of equilibrium.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But why does not water, as well as ether, reduce its own temperature
by evaporating?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The fact is that it does, though much less rapidly than ether. Thus,
for instance, you may often have observed, in the heat of summer, how
much any particular spot may be cooled by watering, though the water
used for that purpose be as warm as the air itself. Indeed so much cold
may be produced by the mere evaporation of water, that the inhabitants
of India, by availing themselves of the most favourable circumstances
for this process which their warm climate can afford, namely, the cool
of the night, and situations most exposed to the night breeze, succeed
in causing water to freeze, though the temperature of the air be as high
as 60 degrees. The water is put into shallow earthen trays, so as to
expose an extensive
<span class = "pagenum">151</span>
<a name = "page151" id = "page151"> </a>
surface to the process of evaporation, and in the morning, the water is
found covered with a thin cake of ice, which is collected in sufficient
quantity to be used for purposes of luxury.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How delicious it must be to drink liquids so cold in those tropical
climates! But, Mrs.&nbsp;B., could we not try that experiment?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>If we were in the country, I have no doubt but that we should be able
to freeze water, by the same means, and under similar circumstances. But
we can do it immediately, upon a small scale, in this very room, in
which the thermometer stands at 70 degrees. For this purpose we need
only place some water in a little cup under the receiver of the air-pump

<p>Probably not, because the vapour will not be carried off fast enough;
but this will be accomplished without difficulty if we introduce into
the receiver (fig.&nbsp;1.), in a saucer, or other large shallow vessel,
some strong sulphuric acid, a&nbsp;substance which has a great
attraction for water, whether in the form of vapour, or in the liquid
state. This attraction is such that the acid will instantly absorb the
moisture as it rises from the water, so as to make room for the
formation of fresh vapour; this will of course hasten the process, and
the cold produced from the rapid evaporation of the water, will, in a
few minutes, be sufficient to freeze its surface.<a class = "tag" name =

<p>Thousands of small bubbles already rise through the water from the
internal surface of the cup; what is the reason of this?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>These are bubbles of air which were partly attached to the vessel,
and partly diffused in the water itself; and they expand and rise in
consequence of the atmospheric pressure being removed.</p>

<p>See, Mrs. B.; the thermometer in the cup is sinking fast; it has
already descended to 40 degrees!</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The water seems now and then violently agitated on the surface, as if
it was boiling; and yet the thermometer is descending fast!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You may call it <i>boiling</i>, if you please, for this appearance
is, as well as boiling, owing to the rapid formation of vapour; but
here, as you have just observed, it takes place from the surface, for it
is only when heat is applied to the bottom of the vessel that the vapour
is formed there.&mdash;Now crystals of ice are actually shooting all
over the surface of the water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How beautiful it is! The surface is now entirely frozen&mdash;but the
thermometer remains at 32 degrees.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And so it will, conformably with our doctrine of latent heat, until
the whole of the water is frozen; but it will then again begin to
descend lower and lower, in consequence of the evaporation which goes on
from the surface of the ice.</p>

<p>I will show you a freezing instrument, contrived by Dr. Wollaston,
upon the same principle as Mr. Leslie’s experiment, by which water may
be frozen by its own evaporation alone, without the assistance of
sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>This tube, which, as you see (<a class = "smallcaps" href =
"#plateVb">Plate V.</a> fig.&nbsp;2.), is terminated at each extremity
by a bulb, one of which is half full of water, is internally perfectly
exhausted of air; the consequence of this is, that the water in the bulb
is always much disposed to evaporate. This evaporation, however, does
not proceed sufficiently fast to freeze the water; but if the empty ball
be cooled by some artificial means, so as to condense quickly the vapour
which rises from the water, the process may be thus so much promoted as
to cause the water to freeze in the other ball. Dr. Wollaston has called
this instrument <i>Cryophorus</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>True: but we have other means of effecting this.<a class = "tag" name

intense cold can be produced by the evaporation of ether in an exhausted
receiver. We shall inclose the bulb in this little bag of fine flannel
(fig.&nbsp;3.), then soke it in ether, and introduce it into the
receiver of the air-pump. (Fig.&nbsp;5.) For this purpose we shall find
it more convenient to use a cryophorus of this shape (fig.&nbsp;4.), as
its elongated bulb passes easily through a brass plate which closes the
top of the receiver. If we now exhaust the receiver quickly, you will
see, in less than a minute, the water freeze in the other bulb, out of
the receiver.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The bulb already looks quite dim, and small drops of water are
condensing on its surface.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">156</span>
<a name = "page156" id = "page156"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And now crystals of ice shoot all over the water. This is, indeed,
a&nbsp;very curious experiment!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You will see, some other day, that, by a similar method, even
quicksilver may be frozen.&mdash;But we cannot at present indulge in any
further digression.</p>

<p>Having advanced so far on the subject of heat, I&nbsp;may now give
you an account of the calorimeter, an instrument invented by Lavoisier,
upon the principles just explained, for the purpose of estimating the
specific heat of bodies. It consists of a vessel, the inner surface of
which is lined with ice, so as to form a sort of hollow globe of ice, in
the midst of which the body, whose specific heat is to be ascertained,
is placed. The ice absorbs caloric from this body, till it has brought
it down to the freezing point; this caloric converts into water a
certain portion of the ice which runs out through an aperture at the
bottom of the machine; and the quantity of ice changed to water is a
test of the quantity of caloric which the body has given out in
descending from a certain temperature to the freezing point.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>In this apparatus, I suppose, the milk, chalk,
<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
<a name = "page157" id = "page157"> </a>
and lead, would melt different quantities of ice, in proportion to their
different capacities for caloric?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly: and thence we are able to ascertain, with precision, their
respective capacities for heat. But the calorimeter affords us no more
idea of the absolute quantity of heat contained in a body, than the
thermometer; for though by means of it we extricate both the free and
combined caloric, yet we extricate them only to a certain degree, which
is the freezing point; and we know not how much they contain of either
below that point.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>According to the theory of latent heat, it appears to me that the
weather should be warm when it freezes, and cold in a thaw: for latent
heat is liberated from every substance that it freezes, and such a large
supply of heat must warm the atmosphere; whilst, during a thaw, that
very quantity of free heat must be taken from the atmosphere, and return
to a latent state in the bodies which it thaws.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Your observation is very natural; but consider that in a frost the
atmosphere is so much colder than the earth, that all the caloric which
it takes
<span class = "pagenum">158</span>
<a name = "page158" id = "page158"> </a>
from the freezing bodies is insufficient to raise its temperature above
the freezing point; otherwise the frost must cease. But if the quantity
of latent heat extricated does not destroy the frost, it serves to
moderate the suddenness of the change of temperature of the atmosphere,
at the commencement both of frost, and of a thaw. In the first instance,
its extrication diminishes the severity of the cold; and, in the latter,
its absorption moderates the warmth occasioned by a thaw: it even
sometimes produces a discernible chill, at the breaking up of a
frost.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But what are the general causes that produce those sudden changes in
the weather, especially from hot to cold, which we often experience?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This question would lead us into meteorological discussions, to which
I am by no means competent. One circumstance, however, we can easily
understand. When the air has passed over cold countries, it will
probably arrive here at a temperature much below our own, and then it
must absorb heat from every object it meets with, which will produce a
general fall of temperature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But pray, now that we know so much of the
<span class = "pagenum">159</span>
<a name = "page159" id = "page159"> </a>
effects of heat, will you inform us whether it is really a distinct
body, or, as I have heard, a&nbsp;peculiar kind of motion produced in
bodies?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>As I before told you, there is yet much uncertainty as to the nature
of these subtle agents. But I am inclined to consider heat not as mere
motion, but as a separate substance. Late experiments too appear to make
it a compound body, consisting of the two electricities, and in our next
conversation I shall inform you of the principal facts on which that
opinion is founded.</p>

<p>I have placed electricity in that list, rather from the necessity of
classing it somewhere, than from any conviction that it has a right to
that situation, for we are as yet so ignorant of its intimate nature,
that we are unable to determine, not only whether it is simple or
compound, but whether it is in fact a material agent; or, as Sir H. Davy
has hinted, whether it may not be merely a property inherent
<span class = "pagenum">161</span>
<a name = "page161" id = "page161"> </a>
in matter. As, however, it is necessary to adopt some hypothesis for the
explanation of the discoveries which this agent has enabled us to make,
I&nbsp;have chosen the opinion, at present most prevalent, which
supposes the existence of two kinds of electricity, distinguished by the
names of <i>positive</i> and <i>negative</i> electricity.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Well, I&nbsp;must confess, I do not feel nearly so interested in a
science in which so much uncertainty prevails, as in those which rest
upon established principles; I&nbsp;never was fond of electricity,
because, however beautiful and curious the phenomena it exhibits may be,
the theories, by which they were explained, appeared to me so various,
so obscure and inadequate, that I always remained dissatisfied.
I&nbsp;was in hopes that the new discoveries in electricity had thrown
so great a light on the subject, that every thing respecting it would
now have been clearly explained.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is a point which we are yet far from having attained. But, in
spite of the imperfection of our theories, you will be amply repaid by
the importance and novelty of the subject. The number of new facts which
have already been ascertained, and the immense prospect of discovery
<span class = "pagenum">162</span>
<a name = "page162" id = "page162"> </a>
which has lately been opened to us, will, I&nbsp;hope, ultimately lead
to a perfect elucidation of this branch of natural science; but at
present you must be contented with studying the effects, and in some
degree explaining the phenomena, without aspiring to a precise knowledge
of the remote cause of electricity.</p>

<p>You have already obtained some notions of electricity: in our present
conversation, therefore, I&nbsp;shall confine myself to that part of the
science which is of late discovery, and is more particularly connected
with chemistry.</p>

<p>It was a trifling and accidental circumstance which first gave rise
to this new branch of physical science. Galvani, a&nbsp;professor of
natural philosophy at Bologna, being engaged (about twenty years ago) in
some experiments on muscular irritability, observed, that when a piece
of metal was laid on the nerve of a frog, recently dead, whilst the limb
supplied by that nerve rested upon some other metal, the limb suddenly
moved, on a communication being made between the two pieces of
metal.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>How is this communication made?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Either by bringing the two metals into contact, or by connecting them
by means of a metallic conductor.
<span class = "pagenum">163</span>
<a name = "page163" id = "page163"> </a>
But without subjecting a frog to any cruel experiments, I&nbsp;can
easily make you sensible of this kind of electric action. Here is a
piece of zinc, (one of the metals I mentioned in the list of elementary
bodies)&mdash;put it <i>under</i> your tongue, and this piece of silver
<i>upon</i> your tongue, and let both the metals project a little beyond
the tip of the tongue&mdash;very well&mdash;now make the projecting
parts of the metals touch each other, and you will instantly perceive a
peculiar sensation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Indeed I did, a singular taste, and I think a degree of heat: but I
can hardly describe&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The action of these two pieces of metal on the tongue is,
I&nbsp;believe, precisely similar to that made on the nerve of a frog.
I&nbsp;shall not detain you by a detailed account of the theory by which
Galvani attempted to account for this fact, as his explanation was soon
overturned by subsequent experiments, which proved that <i>Galvanism</i>
(the name this new power had obtained) was nothing more than
electricity. Galvani supposed that the virtue of this new agent resided
in the nerves of the frog, but Volta, who prosecuted this subject with
much greater success, shewed that the phenomena did not depend on the
organs of the frog, but upon
<span class = "pagenum">164</span>
<a name = "page164" id = "page164"> </a>
the electrical agency of the metals, which is excited by the moisture of
the animal, the organs of the frog being only a delicate test of the
presence of electric influence.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I suppose, then, the saliva of the mouth answers the same purpose as
the moisture of the frog, in exciting the electricity of the pieces of
silver and zinc with which Emily tried the experiment on her tongue.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Precisely. It does not appear, however, necessary that the fluid used
for this purpose should be of an animal nature. Water, and acids very
much diluted by water, are found to be the most effectual in promoting
the developement of electricity in metals; and, accordingly, the
original apparatus which Volta first constructed for this purpose,
consisted of a pile or succession of plates of zinc and copper, each
pair of which was connected by pieces of cloth or paper impregnated with
water; and this instrument, from its original inconvenient structure and
limited strength, has gradually arrived at its present state of power
and improvement, such as is exhibited in the Voltaic battery. In this
apparatus, a&nbsp;specimen of which you see before you (<a class =
"smallcaps" href = "#plateVI">Plate VI.</a> fig.&nbsp;1.), the plates of
zinc and copper are soldered together in pairs, each pair being placed

<p>Though you will not allow us to enquire into the precise cause of
electricity, may we not ask in what manner the fluid acts on the metals
so as to produce&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The action of the fluid on the metals, whether water or acid be used,
is entirely of a chemical nature. But whether electricity is excited by
this chemical action, or whether it is produced by the contact of the
two metals, is a point upon which philosophers do not yet perfectly
agree.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But can the mere contact of two metals, without any intervening
fluid, produce electricity?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, if they are afterwards separated. It is an established fact,
that when two metals are put in contact, and afterwards separated, that
which has the strongest attraction for oxygen exhibits signs of
positive, the other of negative electricity.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It seems then but reasonable to infer that the
<span class = "pagenum">166</span>
<a name = "page166" id = "page166"> </a>
power of the Voltaic battery should arise from the contact of the plates
of zinc and copper.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is upon this principle that Volta and Sir H. Davy explain the
phenomena of the pile; but notwithstanding these two great authorities,
many philosophers entertain doubts on the truth of this theory. The
principal difficulty which occurs in explaining the phenomena of the
Voltaic battery on this principle, is, that two such plates show no
signs of different states of electricity whilst in contact, but only on
being separated after contact. Now in the Voltaic battery, those plates
that are in contact always continue so, being soldered together: and
they cannot therefore receive a succession of charges. Besides, if we
consider the mere disturbance of the balance of electricity by the
contact of the plates, as the sole cause of the production of Voltaic
electricity, it remains to be explained how this disturbed balance
becomes an inexhaustible source of electrical energy, capable of pouring
forth a constant and copious supply of electrical fluid, though without
any means of replenishing itself from other sources. This subject, it
must be owned, is involved in too much obscurity to enable us to speak
very decidedly in favour of any theory. But, in order to avoid
perplexing you with different explanations,
<span class = "pagenum">167</span>
<a name = "page167" id = "page167"> </a>
I shall confine myself to one which appears to me to be least encumbered
with difficulties, and most likely to accord with truth.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag14" id = "tag14" href = "#note14">*</a></p>

<p>This theory supposes the electricity to be excited by the chemical
action of the acid on the zinc; but you are yet such novices in
chemistry, that I think it will be necessary to give you some previous
explanation of the nature of this action.</p>

<p>All metals have a strong attraction for oxygen, and this element is
found in great abundance both in water and in acids. The action of the
diluted acid on the zinc consists therefore in its oxygen combining with
it, and dissolving its surface.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>In the same manner I suppose as we saw an acid dissolve copper?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but in the Voltaic battery the diluted acid is not strong enough
to produce so complete
<span class = "pagenum">168</span>
<a name = "page168" id = "page168"> </a>
an effect; it acts only on the surface of the zinc, to which it yields
its oxygen, forming upon it a film or crust, which is a compound of the
oxygen and the metal.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Since there is so strong a chemical attraction between oxygen and
metals, I&nbsp;suppose they are naturally in different states of
electricity?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; it appears that all metals are united with the positive, and
that oxygen is the grand source of the negative electricity.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Does not then the acid act on the plates of copper, as well as on
those of zinc?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; for though copper has an affinity for oxygen, it is less strong
than that of zinc; and therefore the energy of the acid is only exerted
upon the zinc.</p>

<p>It will be best, I believe, in order to render the action of the
Voltaic battery more intelligible, to confine our attention at first to
the effect produced on two plates only. (<a class = "smallcaps" href =
"#plateVI">Plate VI.</a> fig.&nbsp;2.)</p>

<p>If a plate of zinc be placed opposite to one of copper, or any other
metal less attractive of oxygen,
<span class = "pagenum">169</span>
<a name = "page169" id = "page169"> </a>
and the space between them (suppose of half an inch in thickness), be
filled with an acid or any fluid capable of oxydating the zinc, the
oxydated surface will have its capacity for electricity diminished, so
that a quantity of electricity will be evolved from that surface. This
electricity will be received by the contiguous fluid, by which it will
be transmitted to the opposite metallic surface, the copper, which is
not oxydated, and is therefore disposed to receive it; so that the
copper plate will thus become positive, whilst the zinc plate will be in
the negative state.</p>

<p>This evolution of electrical fluid however will be very limited; for
as these two plates admit of but very little accumulation of
electricity, and are supposed to have no communication with other
bodies, the action of the acid, and further developement of electricity,
will be immediately stopped.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This action, I suppose, can no more continue to go on, than that of a
common electrical machine, which is not allowed to communicate with
other bodies?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Precisely; the common electrical machine, when excited by the
friction of the rubber, gives out both the positive and negative
electricities.&mdash;(<a class = "smallcaps" href = "#plateVIb">Plate
VI.</a> Fig.&nbsp;3.) The positive, by the rotation
<span class = "pagenum">170</span>
<a name = "page170" id = "page170"> </a>
of the glass cylinder, is conveyed into the conductor, whilst the
negative goes into the rubber. But unless there is a communication made
between the rubber and the ground, but a very inconsiderable quantity of
electricity can be excited; for the rubber, like the plates of the
battery, has too small a capacity to admit of an accumulation of
electricity. Unless therefore the electricity can pass out of the
rubber, it will not continue to go into it, and consequently no
additional accumulation will take place. Now as one kind of electricity
cannot be given out without the other, the developement of the positive
electricity is stopped as well as that of the negative, and the

<p>But does not the conductor, as well as the rubber, require a
communication with the earth, in order to get rid of its
electricity?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; for it is susceptible of receiving and containing a considerable
quantity of electricity, as it is much larger than the rubber, and
therefore has a greater capacity; and this continued accumulation of
electricity in the conductor is what is called a charge.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">171</span>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But when an electrical machine is furnished with two conductors to
receive the two electricities, I&nbsp;suppose no communication with the
earth is required?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly not, until the two are fully charged; for the two
conductors will receive equal quantities of electricity.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I thought the use of the chain had been to convey the electricity
<i>from</i> the ground into the machine?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That was the idea of Dr. Franklin, who supposed that there was but
one kind of electricity, and who, by the terms positive and negative
(which he first introduced), meant only different quantities of the same
kind of electricity. The chain was in that case supposed to convey
electricity <i>from</i> the ground through the rubber into the
conductor. But as we have adopted the hypothesis of two electricities,
we must consider the chain as a vehicle to conduct the negative
electricity into the earth.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And are both kinds of electricity produced whenever electricity is
excited?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">172</span>
<a name = "page172" id = "page172"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, invariably. If you rub a tube of glass with a woollen cloth, the
glass becomes positive, and the cloth negative. If, on the contrary, you
excite a stick of sealing-wax by the same means, it is the rubber which
becomes positive, and the wax negative.</p>

<p>But with regard to the Voltaic battery, in order that the acid may
act freely on the zinc, and the two electricities be given out without
interruption, some method must be devised, by which the plates may part
with their electricities as fast as they receive them.&mdash;Can you
think of any means by which this might be effected?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Would not two chains or wires, suspended from either plate to the
ground, conduct the electricities into the earth, and thus answer the
purpose?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It would answer the purpose of carrying off the electricity,
I&nbsp;admit; but recollect, that though it is necessary to find a vent
for the electricity, yet we must not lose it, since it is the power
which we are endeavouring to obtain. Instead, therefore, of conducting
it into the ground, let us make the wires, from either plate, meet: the
two electricities will thus be brought together, and will combine
<span class = "pagenum">173</span>
<a name = "page173" id = "page173"> </a>
and neutralize each other; and as long as this communication continues,
the two plates having a vent for their respective electricities, the
action of the acid will go on freely and uninterruptedly.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That is very clear, so far as two plates only are concerned; but I
cannot say I understand how the energy of the succession of plates, or
rather pairs of plates, of which the Galvanic trough is composed, is
propagated and accumulated throughout a battery?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>In order to shew you how the intensity of the electricity is
increased by increasing the number of plates, we will examine the action
of four plates; if you understand these, you will readily comprehend
that of any number whatever. In this figure (<a class = "smallcaps" href
= "#plateVI">Plate VI.</a> Fig.&nbsp;4.), you will observe that the two
central plates are united; they are soldered together, (as we observed
in describing the Voltaic trough,) so as to form but one plate which
offers two different surfaces, the one of copper, the other of zinc.</p>

<p>Now you recollect that, in explaining the action of two plates, we
supposed that a quantity of electricity was evolved from the surface of
the first zinc plate, in consequence of the action of the acid, and was
conveyed by the interposed fluid to the copper
<span class = "pagenum">174</span>
<a name = "page174" id = "page174"> </a>
plate, No.&nbsp;2, which thus became positive. This copper plate
communicates its electricity to the contiguous zinc plate, No.&nbsp;3,
in which, consequently, some accumulation of electricity takes place.
When, therefore, the fluid in the next cell acts upon the zinc plate,
electricity is extricated from it in larger quantity, and in a more
concentrated form, than before. This concentrated electricity is again
conveyed by the fluid to the next pair of plates, No. 4 and&nbsp;5, when
it is farther increased by the action of the fluid in the third cell,
and so on, to any number of plates of which the battery may consist; so
that the electrical energy will continue to accumulate in proportion to
the number of double plates, the first zinc plate of the series being
the most negative, and the last copper plate the most positive.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But does the battery become more and more strongly charged, merely by
being allowed to stand undisturbed?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No, for the action will soon stop, as was explained before, unless a
vent be given to the accumulated electricities. This is easily done,
however, by establishing a communication by means of the wires
(Fig.&nbsp;1.), between the two ends of the battery: these being brought
into contact, the two
<span class = "pagenum">175</span>
<a name = "page175" id = "page175"> </a>
electricities meet and neutralize each other, producing the shock and
other effects of electricity; and the action goes on with renewed
energy, being no longer obstructed by the accumulation of the two
electricities which impeded its progress.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is it the union of the two electricities which produces the electric
spark?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; and it is, I believe, this circumstance which gave rise to Sir
H. Davy’s opinion that caloric may be a compound of the two
electricities.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yet surely caloric is very different from the electrical spark?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The difference may consist probably only in intensity: for the heat
of the electric spark is considerably more intense, though confined to a
very minute spot, than any heat we can produce by other means.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is it quite certain that the electricity of the Voltaic battery is
precisely of the same nature as that of the common electrical
machine?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">176</span>
<a name = "page176" id = "page176"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly; the shock given to the human body, the spark, the
circumstance of the same substances which are conductors of the one
being also conductors of the other, and of those bodies, such as glass
and sealing-wax, which are non-conductors of the one, being also
non-conductors of the other, are striking proofs of it. Besides, Sir H.
Davy has shewn in his Lectures, that a Leyden jar, and a common electric
battery, can be charged with electricity obtained from a Voltaic
battery, the effect produced being perfectly similar to that obtained by
a common machine.</p>

<p>Dr. Wollaston has likewise proved that similar chemical
decompositions are effected by the electric machine and by the Voltaic
battery; and has made other experiments which render it highly probable,
that the origin of both electricities is essentially the same, as they
show that the rubber of the common electrical machine, like the zinc in
the Voltaic battery, produces the two electricities by combining with
oxygen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But I do not see whence the rubber obtains oxygen, for there is
neither acid nor water used in the common machine, and I always
understood that the electricity was excited by the friction.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">177</span>
<a name = "page177" id = "page177"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It appears that by friction the rubber obtains oxygen from the
atmosphere, which is partly composed of that element. The oxygen
combines with the amalgam of the rubber, which is of a metallic nature,
much in the same way as the oxygen of the acid combines with the zinc in
the Voltaic battery, and it is thus that the two electricities are
disengaged.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But, if the electricities of both machines are similar, why not use
the common machine for chemical decompositions?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Though its effects are similar to those of the Voltaic battery, they
are incomparably weaker. Indeed Dr. Wollaston, in using it for chemical
decompositions, was obliged to act upon the most minute quantities of
matter, and though the result was satisfactory in proving the similarity
of its effects to those of the Voltaic battery, these effects were too
small in extent to be in any considerable degree applicable to chemical
decomposition.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How terrible, then, the shock must be from a Voltaic battery, since
it is so much more powerful than an electrical machine!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">178</span>
<a name = "page178" id = "page178"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is not nearly so formidable as you think; at least it is by no
means proportional to the chemical effect. The great superiority of the
Voltaic battery consists in the large <i>quantity</i> of electricity
that passes; but in regard to the <i>rapidity</i> or <i>intensity</i> of
the charge, it is greatly surpassed by the common electrical machine. It
would seem that the shock or sensation depends chiefly upon the
intensity; whilst, on the contrary, for chemical purposes, it is
quantity which is required. In the Voltaic battery, the electricity,
though copious, is so weak as not to be able to force its way through
the fluid which separates the plates, whilst that of a common machine
will pass through any space of water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Would not it be possible to increase the intensity of the Voltaic
battery till it should equal that of the common machine?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It can actually be increased till it imitates a weak electrical
machine, so as to produce a visible spark when accumulated in a Leyden
jar. But it can never be raised sufficiently to pass through any
considerable extent of air, because of the ready communication through
the fluids employed.</p>

<p>By increasing the number of plates of a battery,
<span class = "pagenum">179</span>
<a name = "page179" id = "page179"> </a>
you increase its <i>intensity</i>, whilst, by enlarging the dimensions
of the plates, you augment its <i>quantity</i>; and, as the superiority
of the battery over the common machine consists entirely in the quantity
of electricity produced, it was at first supposed that it was the size,
rather than the number of plates that was essential to the augmentation
of power. It was, however, found upon trial, that the quantity of
electricity produced by the Voltaic battery, even when of a very
moderate size, was sufficiently copious, and that the chief advantage in
this apparatus was obtained by increasing the intensity, which, however,
still falls very short of that of the common machine.</p>

<p>I should not omit to mention, that a very splendid, and, at the same
time, most powerful battery, was, a&nbsp;few years ago, constructed
under the direction of Sir H. Davy, which he repeatedly exhibited in his
course of electro-chemical lectures. It consists of two thousand double
plates of zinc and copper, of six square inches in dimensions, arranged
in troughs of Wedgwood-ware, each of which contains twenty of these
plates. The troughs are furnished with a contrivance for lifting the
plates out of them in a very convenient and expeditious manner.<a class

This mode of explaining the phenomena of the Voltaic pile is called the
<i>chemical theory</i> of electricity, because it ascribes the cause of
these phenomena to certain chemical changes which take place during
their appearance. In the preceding edition of this work, the same theory
was presented in a more elaborate, but less easy form than it is in
this. The mode of viewing the subject which is here sketched was long
since suggested by Dr. Bostock, of whose theory, however, this is by no
means to be considered as a complete statement.</p>

<p>Such substances may be considered rather as heterogeneous
<span class = "pagenum">182</span>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray what is a gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The name of gas is given to any fluid capable of existing constantly
in an aeriform state, under the pressure and at the temperature of the
atmosphere.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is not water, or any other substance, when evaporated by heat, called
gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No, my dear; vapour is, indeed, an elastic fluid, and bears a strong
resemblance to a gas; there are, however, several points in which they
essentially differ, and by which you may always distinguish them. Steam,
or vapour, owes its elasticity merely to a high temperature, which is
equal to that of boiling water. And it differs from boiling water only
by being united with more caloric, which, as we before explained, is in
a latent state. When
<span class = "pagenum">183</span>
<a name = "page183" id = "page183"> </a>
steam is cooled, it instantly returns to the form of water; but air, or
gas, has never yet been rendered liquid or solid by any degree of
cold.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But does not gas, as well as vapour, owe its elasticity to
caloric?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It was the prevailing opinion; and the difference of gas or vapour
was thought to depend on the different manner in which caloric was
united with the basis of these two kinds of elastic fluids. In vapour,
it was considered as in a latent state; in gas, it was said to be
chemically combined. But the late researches of Sir H. Davy have given
rise to a new theory respecting gasses; and there is now reason to
believe that these bodies owe their permanently elastic state, not
solely to caloric, but likewise to the prevalence of either the one or
the other of the two electricities.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>When you speak, then, of the simple bodies oxygen and nitrogen, you
mean to express those substances which are the basis of the two
gasses?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, in strict propriety, for they can properly be called gasses only
when brought to an aeriform state.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">184</span>
<a name = "page184" id = "page184"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>In what proportions are they combined in the atmosphere?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The oxygen gas constitutes a little more than one-fifth, and the
nitrogen gas a little less than four-fifths. When separated, they are
found to possess qualities totally different from each other. For oxygen
gas is essential both to respiration and combustion, while neither of
these processes can be performed in nitrogen gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But if nitrogen gas is unfit for respiration, how does it happen that
the large proportion of it which enters into the composition of the
atmosphere is not a great impediment to breathing?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We should breathe more freely than our lungs could bear, if we
respired oxygen gas alone. The nitrogen is no impediment to respiration,
and probably, on the contrary, answers some useful purpose, though we do
not know in what manner it acts in that process.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And by what means can the two gasses, which compose the atmospheric
air, be separated?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">185</span>
<a name = "page185" id = "page185"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There are many ways of analysing the atmosphere: the two gasses may
be separated first by combustion.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>You surprise me! how is it possible that combustion should separate
them?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I should previously remind you that oxygen is supposed to be the only
simple body naturally combined with negative electricity. In all the
other elements the positive electricity prevails, and they have
consequently, all of them, an attraction for oxygen.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag16" id = "tag16" href = "#note16">*</a></p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Oxygen the only negatively electrified body! that surprises me
extremely; how then are the combinations of the other bodies performed,
if, according to your explanation of chemical attraction, bodies are
supposed only to combine in virtue of their opposite states of
electricity?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">186</span>
<a name = "page186" id = "page186"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Observe that I said, that oxygen was the only <i>simple</i> body,
naturally negative. Compound bodies, in which oxygen prevails over the
other component parts, are also negative, but their negative energy is
greater or less in proportion as the oxygen predominates. Those
compounds into which oxygen enters in less proportion than the other
constituents, are positive, but their positive energy is diminished in
proportion to the quantity of oxygen which enters into their
composition.</p>

<p>All bodies, therefore, that are not already combined with oxygen,
will attract it, and, under certain circumstances, will absorb it from
the atmosphere, in which case the nitrogen gas will remain alone, and
may thus be obtained in its separate state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I do not understand how a gas can be absorbed?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is only the oxygen, or basis of the gas, which is absorbed; and
the two electricities escaping, that is to say, the negative from the
oxygen, the positive from the burning body, unite and produce
caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And what becomes of this caloric?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">187</span>
<a name = "page187" id = "page187"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We shall make this piece of dry wood attract oxygen from the
atmosphere, and you will see what becomes of the caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>You are joking, Mrs. B&mdash;; you do not mean to decompose the
atmosphere with a piece of dry stick?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not the whole body of the atmosphere, certainly; but if we can make
this piece of wood attract any quantity of oxygen from it,
a&nbsp;proportional quantity of atmospherical air will be
decomposed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>If wood has so strong an attraction for oxygen, why does it not
decompose the atmosphere spontaneously?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is found by experience, that an elevation of temperature is
required for the commencement of the union of the oxygen and the
wood.</p>

<p>This elevation of temperature was formerly thought to be necessary,
in order to diminish the cohesive attraction of the wood, and enable the
oxygen to penetrate and combine with it more readily. But since the
introduction of the new theory of chemical combination, another cause
has
<span class = "pagenum">188</span>
<a name = "page188" id = "page188"> </a>
been assigned, and it is now supposed that the high temperature, by
exalting the electrical energies of bodies, and consequently their force
of attraction, facilitates their combination.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>If it is true, that caloric is composed of the two electricities, an
elevation of temperature must necessarily augment the electric energies
of bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I doubt whether that would be a necessary consequence; for, admitting
this composition of caloric, it is only by its being decomposed that
electricity can be produced. Sir H. Davy, however, in his numerous
experiments, has found it to be an almost invariable rule that the
electrical energies of bodies are increased by elevation of
temperature.</p>

<p>What means then shall we employ to raise the temperature of the wood,
so as to enable it to attract oxygen from the atmosphere?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Holding it near the fire, I should think, would answer the
purpose.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It may, provided you hold it sufficiently close
<span class = "pagenum">189</span>
<a name = "page189" id = "page189"> </a>
to the fire; for a very considerable elevation of temperature is
required.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It has actually taken fire, and yet I did not let it touch the coals,
but I held it so very close that I suppose it caught fire merely from
the intensity of the heat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Or you might say, in other words, that the caloric which the wood
imbibed, so much elevated its temperature, and exalted its electric
energy, as to enable it to attract oxygen very rapidly from the
atmosphere.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Does the wood absorb oxygen while it is burning?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, and the heat and light are produced by the union of the two
electricities which are set at liberty, in consequence of the oxygen
combining with the wood.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>You astonish me! the heat of a burning body proceeds then as much
from the atmosphere as from the body itself?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It was supposed that the caloric, given out
<span class = "pagenum">190</span>
<a name = "page190" id = "page190"> </a>
during combustion, proceeded entirely, or nearly so, from the
decomposition of the oxygen gas; but, according to Sir H. Davy’s new
view of the subject, both the oxygen gas, and the combustible body,
concur in supplying the heat and light, by the union of their opposite
electricities.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I have not yet met with any thing in chemistry that has surprised or
delighted me so much as this explanation of combustion. I&nbsp;was at
first wondering what connection there could be between the affinity of a
body for oxygen and its combustibility; but I think I understand it now
perfectly.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Combustion then, you see, is nothing more than the rapid combination
of a body with oxygen, attended by the disengagement of light and
heat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But are there no combustible bodies whose attraction for oxygen is so
strong, that they will combine with it, without the application of
heat?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That cannot be; otherwise we should see bodies burning
spontaneously.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">191</span>
<a name = "page191" id = "page191"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But there are some instances of this kind, such as phosphorus,
potassium, and some compound bodies, which I shall hereafter make you
acquainted with. These bodies, however, are prepared by art, for in
general, all the combustions that could occur spontaneously, at the
temperature of the atmosphere, have already taken place; therefore new
combustions cannot happen without the temperature of the body being
raised. Some bodies, however, will burn at a much lower temperature than
others.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But the common way of burning a body is not merely to approach it to
one already on fire, but rather to put the one in actual contact with
the other, as when I burn this piece of paper by holding it in the flame
of the fire.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The closer it is in contact with the source of caloric, the sooner
will its temperature be raised to the degree necessary for it to burn.
If you hold it near the fire, the same effect will be produced; but more
time will be required, as you found to be the case with the piece of
stick.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But why is it not necessary to continue applying
<span class = "pagenum">192</span>
<a name = "page192" id = "page192"> </a>
caloric throughout the process of combustion, in order to keep up the
electric energy of the wood, which is required to enable it to combine
with the oxygen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The caloric which is gradually produced by the two electricities
during combustion, keeps up the temperature of the burning body; so that
when once combustion has begun, no further application of caloric is
required.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Since I have learnt this wonderful theory of combustion,
I&nbsp;cannot take my eyes from the fire; and I can scarcely conceive
that the heat and light, which I always supposed to proceed entirely
from the coals, are really produced as much by the atmosphere.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>When you blow the fire, you increase the combustion, I&nbsp;suppose,
by supplying the coals with a greater quantity of oxygen gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly; but of course no blowing will produce combustion, unless
the temperature of the coals be first raised. A&nbsp;single spark,
however, is sometimes sufficient to produce that effect; for, as I said
before, when once combustion has commenced,
<span class = "pagenum">193</span>
<a name = "page193" id = "page193"> </a>
the caloric disengaged is sufficient to elevate the temperature of the
rest of the body, provided that there be a free access of oxygen. It
however sometimes happens that if a fire be ill made, it will be
extinguished before all the fuel is consumed, from the very circumstance
of the combustion being so slow that the caloric disengaged is
insufficient to keep up the temperature of the fuel. You must recollect
that there are three things required in order to produce combustion;
a&nbsp;combustible body, oxygen, and a temperature at which the one will
combine with the other.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>You said that combustion was one method of decomposing the
atmosphere, and obtaining the nitrogen gas in its simple state; but how
do you secure this gas, and prevent it from mixing with the rest of the
atmosphere?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is necessary for this purpose to burn the body within a close
vessel, which is easily done.&mdash;We shall introduce a small lighted
taper (<a class = "smallcaps" href = "#plateVII">Plate VII.</a>

<p>How dim the light burns already!&mdash;It is now extinguished.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Can you tell us why it is extinguished?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Let me consider.&mdash;The receiver was full of atmospherical air;
the taper, in burning within it, must have combined with the oxygen
contained in that air, and the caloric that was disengaged produced the
light of the taper. But when the whole of the oxygen was absorbed, the
whole of its electricity was disengaged; consequently no more caloric
could be produced, the taper ceased to burn, and the flame was
extinguished.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Your explanation is perfectly correct.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The two constituents of the oxygen gas being thus disposed of, what
remains under the receiver must be pure nitrogen gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There are some circumstances which prevent the nitrogen gas, thus
obtained, from being perfectly pure; but we may easily try whether the
<span class = "pagenum">195</span>
<a name = "page195" id = "page195"> </a>
oxygen has disappeared, by putting another lighted taper under
it.&mdash;You see how instantaneously the flame is extinguished, for
want of oxygen to supply the negative electricity required for the
formation of caloric; and were you to put an animal under the receiver,
it would immediately be suffocated. But that is an experiment which I do
not think your curiosity will tempt you to try.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Certainly not.&mdash;But look, Mrs. B., the receiver is full of a
thick white smoke. Is that nitrogen gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No, my dear; nitrogen gas is perfectly transparent and invisible,
like common air. This cloudiness proceeds from a variety of exhalations,
which arise from the burning taper, and the nature of which you cannot
yet understand.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The water within the receiver has now risen a little above its level
in the bason. What is the reason of this?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>With a moment’s reflection, I dare say, you would have explained it
yourself. The water rises in consequence of the oxygen gas within it
<span class = "pagenum">196</span>
<a name = "page196" id = "page196"> </a>
having been destroyed, or rather decomposed, by the combustion of the
taper.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Then why did not the water rise immediately when the oxygen gas was
destroyed?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because the heat of the taper, whilst burning, produced a dilatation
of the air in the vessel, which at first counteracted this effect.</p>

<p>Another means of decomposing the atmosphere is the <i>oxygenation</i>
of certain metals. This process is very analogous to combustion; it is,
indeed, only a more general term to express the combination of a body
with oxygen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>In what respect, then, does it differ from combustion?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The combination of oxygen in combustion is always accompanied by a
disengagement of light and heat; whilst this circumstance is not a
necessary consequence of simple oxygenation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But how can a body absorb oxygen without the combination of the two
electricities which produce caloric?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">197</span>
<a name = "page197" id = "page197"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Oxygen does not always present itself in a gaseous state; it is a
constituent part of a vast number of bodies, both solid and liquid, in
which it exists in a much denser state than in the atmosphere; and from
these bodies it may be obtained without much disengagement of caloric.
It may likewise, in some cases, be absorbed from the atmosphere without
any sensible production of light and heat; for, if the process be slow,
the caloric is disengaged in such small quantities, and so gradually,
that it is not capable of producing either light or heat. In this case
the absorption of oxygen is called <i>oxygenation</i> or
<i>oxydation</i>, instead of <i>combustion</i>, as the production of
sensible light and heat is essential to the latter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I wonder that metals can unite with oxygen; for, as they are so
dense, their attraction of aggregation must be very great; and I should
have thought that oxygen could never have penetrated such bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Their strong attraction for oxygen counterbalances this obstacle.
Most metals, however, require to be made red-hot before they are capable
of attracting oxygen in any considerable quantity.
<span class = "pagenum">198</span>
<a name = "page198" id = "page198"> </a>
By this combination they lose most of their metallic properties, and
fall into a kind of powder, formerly called <i>calx</i>, but now much
more properly termed an <i>oxyd</i>; thus we have <i>oxyd of lead</i>,
<i>oxyd of iron</i>,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And in the Voltaic battery, it is, I suppose, an oxyd of zinc, that
is formed by the union of the oxygen with that metal?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, it is.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The word oxyd, then, simply means a metal combined with oxygen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but the term is not confined to metals, though chiefly applied
to them. Any body whatever, that has combined with a certain quantity of
oxygen, either by means of oxydation or combustion, is called an
<i>oxyd</i>, and is said to be <i>oxydated</i> or <i>oxygenated</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Metals, when converted into oxyds, become, I&nbsp;suppose,
negative?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not in general; because in most oxyds the positive energy of the
metal more than counterbalances
<span class = "pagenum">199</span>
<a name = "page199" id = "page199"> </a>
the native energy of the oxygen with which it combines.</p>

<p>This black powder is an oxyd of manganese, a&nbsp;metal which has so
strong an affinity for oxygen, that it attracts that substance from the
atmosphere at any known temperature: it is therefore never found in its
metallic form, but always in that of an oxyd, in which state, you see,
it has very little of the appearance of a metal. It is now heavier than
it was before oxydation, in consequence of the additional weight of the
oxygen with which it has combined.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I am very glad to hear that; for I confess I could not help having
some doubts whether oxygen was really a substance, as it is not to be
obtained in a simple and palpable state; but its weight is,
I&nbsp;think, a&nbsp;decisive proof of its being a real body.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is easy to estimate its weight, by separating it from the
manganese, and finding how much the latter has lost.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But if you can take the oxygen from the metal, shall we not then have
it in its palpable simple state?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; for I can only separate the oxygen from
<span class = "pagenum">200</span>
<a name = "page200" id = "page200"> </a>
the manganese, by presenting to it some other body, for which it has a
greater affinity than for the manganese. Caloric affording the two
electricities is decomposed, and one of them uniting with the oxygen,
restores it to the aëriform state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But you said just now, that manganese would attract oxygen from the
atmosphere in which it is combined with the negative electricity; how,
therefore, can the oxygen have a superior affinity for that electricity,
since it abandons it to combine with the manganese?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I give you credit for this objection, Emily; and the only answer I
can make to it is, that the mutual affinities of metals for oxygen, and
of oxygen for electricity, vary at different temperatures;
a&nbsp;certain degree of heat will, therefore, dispose a metal to
combine with oxygen, whilst, on the contrary, the former will be
compelled to part with the latter, when the temperature is further
increased. I&nbsp;have put some oxyd of manganese into a retort, which
is an earthen vessel with a bent neck, such as you see here. (<a class =
"smallcaps" href = "#plateVII">Plate VII.</a> Fig.&nbsp;2.)&mdash;The
retort containing the manganese you cannot see, as I have enclosed it in
this furnace, where it is now red-hot. But, in order to
<span class = "pagenum">201</span>
<a name = "page201" id = "page201"> </a>
make you sensible of the escape of the gas, which is itself invisible,
I&nbsp;have connected the neck of the retort with this bent tube, the
extremity of which is immersed in this vessel of water. (<a class =
"smallcaps" href = "#plateVII">Plate VII.</a> Fig.&nbsp;3.)&mdash;Do you
see the bubbles of air rise through the water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Perfectly. This, then, is pure oxygen gas; what a pity it should be
lost! Could you not preserve&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We shall collect it in this receiver.&mdash;For this purpose, you
observe, I&nbsp;first fill it with water, in order to exclude the
atmospherical air; and then place it over the bubbles that issue from
the retort, so as to make them rise through the water to the upper part
of the receiver.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The bubbles of oxygen gas rise, I suppose, from their specific
levity?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; for though oxygen forms rather a heavy gas, it is light compared
to water. You see how it gradually displaces the water from the
receiver. It is now full of gas, and I may leave it inverted in water on
this shelf, where I can keep the gas
<span class = "pagenum">202</span>
<a name = "page202" id = "page202"> </a>
as long as I choose, for future experiments. This apparatus (which is
indispensable in all experiments in which gases are concerned) is called
a water-bath.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is a very clever contrivance, indeed; equally simple and useful.
How convenient the shelf is for the receiver to rest upon under water,
and the holes in it for the gas to pass into the receiver! I&nbsp;long
to make some experiments with this apparatus.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I shall try your skill that way, when you have a little more
experience. I&nbsp;am now going to show you an experiment, which proves,
in a very striking manner, how essential oxygen is to combustion. You
will see that iron itself will burn in this gas, in the most rapid and
brilliant manner.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Really! I did not know that it was possible to burn iron.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Iron is a simple body, and you know, Caroline, that all simple bodies
are naturally positive, and therefore must have an affinity for
oxygen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Iron will, however, not burn in atmospherical
<span class = "pagenum">203</span>
<a name = "page203" id = "page203"> </a>
air without a very great elevation of temperature; but it is eminently
combustible in pure oxygen gas; and what will surprise you still more,
it can be set on fire without any considerable rise of temperature. You
see this spiral iron wire&mdash;I&nbsp;fasten it at one end to this
cork, which is made to fit an opening at the top of the glass-receiver.
(<a class = "smallcaps" href = "#plateVII">Plate VII.</a>
Fig.&nbsp;4.)</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I see the opening in the receiver; but it is carefully closed by a
ground glass-stopper.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is in order to prevent the gas from escaping; but I shall take
out the stopper, and put in the cork, to which the wire hangs.&mdash;Now
I mean to burn this wire in the oxygen gas, but I must fix a small piece
of lighted tinder to the extremity of it, in order to give the first
impulse to combustion; for, however powerful oxygen is in promoting
combustion, you must recollect that it cannot take place without some
elevation of temperature. I&nbsp;shall now introduce the wire into the
receiver, by quickly changing the stoppers.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is there no danger of the gas escaping while you change the
stoppers?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">204</span>
<a name = "page204" id = "page204"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Oxygen gas is a little heavier than atmospherical air, therefore it
will not mix with it very rapidly; and, if I do not leave the opening
uncovered, we shall not lose any&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Oh, what a brilliant and beautiful flame!</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It is as white and dazzling as the sun!&mdash;Now a piece of the
melted wire drops to the bottom: I&nbsp;fear it is extinguished; but no,
it burns again as bright as ever.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It will burn till the wire is entirely consumed, provided the oxygen
is not first expended: for you know it can burn only while there is
oxygen to combine with&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I never saw a more beautiful light. My eyes can hardly bear it! How
astonishing to think that all this caloric was contained in the small
quantity of gas and iron that was enclosed in the receiver; and that,
without producing any sensible heat!</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How wonderfully quick combustion goes on in pure oxygen gas! But
pray, are these drops of burnt iron as heavy as the wire was before?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">205</span>
<a name = "page205" id = "page205"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They are even heavier; for the iron, in burning, has acquired exactly
the weight of the oxygen which has disappeared, and is now combined with
it. It has become an oxyd of iron.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I do not know what you mean by saying that the oxygen has
<i>disappeared</i>, Mrs.&nbsp;B., for it was always invisible.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>True, my dear; the expression was incorrect. But though you could not
see the oxygen gas, I&nbsp;believe you had no doubt of its presence, as
the effect it produced on the wire was sufficiently evident.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed; yet you know it was the caloric, and not the oxygen gas
itself, that dazzled us so much.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You are not quite correct in your turn, in saying the caloric dazzled
you; for caloric is invisible; it affects only the sense of feeling; it
was the light which dazzled you.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>True; but light and caloric are such constant companions, that it is
difficult to separate them, even in idea.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">206</span>
<a name = "page206" id = "page206"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The easier it is to confound them, the more careful you should be in
making the distinction.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But why has the water now risen, and filled part of the receiver?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Indeed, Caroline, I did not suppose you would have asked such a
question! I&nbsp;dare say, Emily, you can answer&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Let me reflect . . . . . . The oxygen has combined with the wire; the
caloric has escaped; consequently nothing can remain in the receiver,
and the water will rise to fill the vacuum.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I wonder that I did not think of that. I wish that we had weighed the
wire and the oxygen gas before combustion; we might then have found
whether the weight of the oxyd was equal to that of both.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You might try the experiment if you particularly wished it; but I can
assure you, that, if accurately performed, it never fails to show that
the additional weight of the oxyd is precisely equal to that
<span class = "pagenum">207</span>
<a name = "page207" id = "page207"> </a>
of the oxygen absorbed, whether the process has been a real combustion,
or a simple oxygenation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But this cannot be the case with combustions in general; for when any
substance is burnt in the common air, so far from increasing in weight,
it is evidently diminished, and sometimes entirely consumed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But what do you mean by the expression <i>consumed</i>? You cannot
suppose that the smallest particle of any substance in nature can be
actually destroyed. A&nbsp;compound body is decomposed by combustion;
some of its constituent parts fly off in a gaseous form, while others
remain in a concrete state; the former are called the <i>volatile</i>,
the latter the <i>fixed products</i> of combustion. But if we collect
the whole of them, we shall always find that they exceed the weight of
the combustible body, by that of the oxygen which has combined with them
during combustion.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>In the combustion of a coal fire, then, I&nbsp;suppose that the ashes
are what would be called the fixed product, and the smoke the volatile
product?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">208</span>
<a name = "page208" id = "page208"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yet when the fire burns best, and the quantity of volatile products
should be the greatest, there is no smoke; how can you account for
that?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Indeed I cannot; therefore I suppose that I was not right in my
conjecture.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not quite: ashes, as you supposed, are a fixed product of combustion;
but smoke, properly speaking, is not one of the volatile products, as it
consists of some minute undecomposed particles of the coals that are
carried off by the heated air without being burnt, and are either
deposited in the form of soot, or dispersed by the wind. Smoke,
therefore, ultimately, becomes one of the <i>fixed</i> products of
combustion. And you may easily conceive that the stronger the fire is,
the less smoke is produced, because the fewer particles escape
combustion. On this principle depends the invention of Argand’s Patent
Lamps; a&nbsp;current of air is made to pass through the cylindrical
wick of the lamp, by which means it is so plentifully supplied with
oxygen, that scarcely a particle of oil escapes combustion, nor is there
any smoke produced.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But what then are the volatile products of combustion?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">209</span>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Various new compounds, with which you are not yet acquainted, and
which being converted by caloric either into vapour or gas, are
invisible; but they can be collected, and we shall examine them at some
future period.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>There are then other gases, besides the oxygen and nitrogen
gases.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, several: any substance that can assume and maintain the form of
an elastic fluid at the temperature of the atmosphere, is called a gas.
We shall examine the several gases in their respective places; but we
must now confine our attention to those that compose the atmosphere.</p>

<p>I shall show you another method of decomposing the atmosphere, which
is very simple. In breathing, we retain a portion of the oxygen, and
expire the nitrogen gas; so that if we breathe in a closed vessel, for a
certain length of time, the air within it will be deprived of its oxygen
gas. Which of you will make the experiment?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I should be very glad to try it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">210</span>
<a name = "page210" id = "page210"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well; breathe several times through this glass tube into the
receiver with which it is connected, until you feel that your breath is
exhausted.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I am quite out of breath already!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Now let us try the gas with a lighted taper.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It is very pure nitrogen gas, for the taper is immediately
extinguished.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is not a proof of its being pure, but only of the absence of
oxygen, as it is that principle alone which can produce combustion,
every other gas being absolutely incapable of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>In the methods which you have shown us, for decomposing the
atmosphere, the oxygen always abandons the nitrogen; but is there no way
of taking the nitrogen from the oxygen, so as to obtain the latter pure
from the atmosphere?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You must observe, that whenever oxygen is
<span class = "pagenum">211</span>
<a name = "page211" id = "page211"> </a>
taken from the atmosphere, it is by decomposing the oxygen gas; we
cannot do the same with the nitrogen gas, because nitrogen has a
stronger affinity for caloric than for any other known principle: it
appears impossible therefore to separate it from the atmosphere by the
power of affinities. But if we cannot obtain the oxygen gas, by this
means, in its separate state, we have no difficulty (as you have seen)
to procure it in its gaseous form, by taking it from those substances
that have absorbed it from the atmosphere, as we did with the oxyd of
manganese.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Can atmospherical air be recomposed, by mixing due proportions of
oxygen and nitrogen gases?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes: if about one part of oxygen gas be mixed with about four parts
of nitrogen gas, atmospherical air is produced.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag17" id = "tag17" href = "#note17">*</a></p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The air, then, must be an oxyd of nitrogen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No, my dear; for there must be a chemical
<span class = "pagenum">212</span>
<a name = "page212" id = "page212"> </a>
combination between oxygen and nitrogen in order to produce an oxyd;
whilst in the atmosphere these two substances are separately combined
with caloric, forming two distinct gases, which are simply mixed in the
formation of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>I shall say nothing more of oxygen and nitrogen at present, as we
shall continually have occasion to refer to them in our future
conversations. They are both very abundant in nature; nitrogen is the
most plentiful in the atmosphere, and exists also in all animal
substances; oxygen forms a constituent part, both of the animal and
vegetable kingdoms, from which it may be obtained by a variety of
chemical means. But it is now time to conclude our lesson. I&nbsp;am
afraid you have learnt more to-day than you will be able to
remember.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I assure you that I have been too much interested in it, ever to
forget it. In regard to nitrogen there seems to be but little to
remember; it makes a very insignificant figure in comparison to oxygen,
although it composes a much larger portion of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Perhaps this insignificance you complain of may arise from the
compound nature of nitrogen, for though I have hitherto considered it as
a simple
<span class = "pagenum">213</span>
<a name = "page213" id = "page213"> </a>
body, because it is not known in any natural process to be decomposed,
yet from some experiments of Sir H. Davy, there appears to be reason for
suspecting that nitrogen is a compound body, as we shall see afterwards.
But even in its simple state, it will not appear so insignificant when
you are better acquainted with it; for though it seems to perform but a
passive part in the atmosphere, and has no very striking properties,
when considered in its separate state, yet you will see by-and-bye what
a very important agent it becomes, when combined with other bodies. But
no more of this at present; we must reserve it for its proper place.</p>

<div class = "footnote">

<p><a name = "note16" id = "note16" href = "#tag16">*</a>
If chlorine or oxymuriatic gas be a simple body, according to Sir H.
Davy’s view of the subject, it must be considered as an exception to
this statement; but this subject cannot be discussed till the properties
and nature of chlorine come under examination.</p>

<p>No; for chlorine, in the state of gas, has a distinct greenish
colour, and is therefore visible; and iodine, in the same state, has a
beautiful claret-red colour. The knowledge of these two bodies, however,
and the explanation of their properties, imply various considerations,
which you would not yet be able to understand; we shall therefore defer
their examination to some future conversation, and we shall pass on to
the next simple substance, <span class = "smallcaps">Hydrogen</span>,
which we cannot, any more than oxygen, obtain in a visible or palpable
form. We are acquainted with it only in its gaseous state, as we are
with oxygen and nitrogen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But in its gaseous state it cannot be called a

<a name = "page215" id = "page215"> </a>
simple substance, since it is combined with heat and electricity?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>True, my dear; but as we do not know in nature of any substance which
is not more or less combined with caloric and electricity, we are apt to
say that a substance is in its pure state when combined with those
agents only.</p>

<p>Hydrogen was formerly called <i>inflammable air</i>, as it is
extremely combustible, and burns with a great flame. Since the invention
of the new nomenclature, it has obtained the name of hydrogen, which is
derived from two Greek words, the meaning of which is, <i>to produce
water</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And how does hydrogen produce water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By its combustion. Water is composed of eighty-five parts, by weight,
of oxygen, combined with fifteen parts of hydrogen; or of two parts, by
bulk of hydrogen gas, to one part of oxygen gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Really! is it possible that water should be a combination of two
gases, and that one of these
<span class = "pagenum">216</span>
<a name = "page216" id = "page216"> </a>
should be inflammable air! Hydrogen must be a most extraordinary gas
that will produce both fire and water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But I thought you said that combustion could take place in no gas but
oxygen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Do you recollect what the process of combustion consists&nbsp;in?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>In the combination of a body with oxygen, with disengagement of light
and heat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Therefore when I say that hydrogen is combustible, I&nbsp;mean that
it has an affinity for oxygen; but, like all other combustible
substances, it cannot burn unless supplied with oxygen, and also heated
to a proper temperature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The simply mixing fifteen parts of hydrogen, with eighty-five parts
of oxygen gas, will not, therefore, produce water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; water being a much denser fluid than gases, in order to reduce
these gases to a liquid, it is
<span class = "pagenum">217</span>
<a name = "page217" id = "page217"> </a>
necessary to diminish the quantity of caloric or electricity which
maintains them in an elastic form.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That I should think might be done by combining the oxygen and
hydrogen together; for in combining they would give out their respective
electricities in the form of caloric, and by this means would be
condensed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But you forget, Emily, that in order to make the oxygen and hydrogen
combine, you must begin by elevating their temperature, which increases,
instead of diminishing, their electric energies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Emily is, however, right; for though it is necessary to raise their
temperature, in order to make them combine, as that combination affords
them the means of parting with their electricities, it is eventually the
cause of the diminution of electric energy.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>You love to deal in paradoxes to-day, Mrs.&nbsp;B.&mdash;Fire, then,
produces water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The combustion of hydrogen gas certainly does;
<span class = "pagenum">218</span>
<a name = "page218" id = "page218"> </a>
but you do not seem to have remembered the theory of combustion so well
as you thought you would. Can you tell me what happens in the combustion
of hydrogen gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The hydrogen combines with the oxygen, and their opposite
electricities are disengaged in the form of caloric.&mdash;Yes,
I&nbsp;think I understand it now&mdash;by the loss of this caloric, the
gases are condensed into a liquid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Water, then, I suppose, when it evaporates and incorporates with the
atmosphere, is decomposed and converted into hydrogen and oxygen
gases?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No, my dear&mdash;there you are quite mistaken: the decomposition of
water is totally different from its evaporation; for in the latter case
(as you should recollect) water is only in a state of very minute
division; and is merely suspended in the atmosphere, without any
chemical combination, and without any separation of its constituent
parts. As long as these remain combined, they form <span class =
"smallroman">WATER</span>, whether in a state of liquidity, or in that
of an elastic fluid, as vapour, or under the solid form of ice.</p>

<p>In our experiments on latent heat, you may recollect
<span class = "pagenum">219</span>
<a name = "page219" id = "page219"> </a>
that we caused water successively to pass through these three forms,
merely by an increase or diminution of caloric, without employing any
power of attraction, or effecting any decomposition.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But are there no means of decomposing water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, several: charcoal, and metals, when heated red hot, will attract
the oxygen from water, in the same manner as they will from the
atmosphere.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Hydrogen, I&nbsp;see, is like nitrogen, a poor dependant friend of
oxygen, which is continually forsaken for greater favourites.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The connection, or friendship, as you choose to call it, is much more
intimate between oxygen and hydrogen, in the state of water, than
between oxygen and nitrogen, in the atmosphere; for, in the first case,
there is a chemical union and condensation of the two substances; in the
latter, they are simply mixed together in their gaseous state. You will
find, however, that, in some cases, nitrogen is quite as intimately
connected with oxygen, as hydrogen is.&mdash;But this is foreign to our
present subject.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">220</span>
<a name = "page220" id = "page220"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Water, then, is an oxyd, though the atmospherical air is not?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is not commonly called an oxyd, though, according to our
definition, it may, no doubt, be referred to that class of bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I should like extremely to see water decomposed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I can gratify your curiosity by a much more easy process than the
oxydation of charcoal or metals: the decomposition of water by these
latter means takes up a great deal of time, and is attended with much
trouble; for it is necessary that the charcoal or metal should be made
red hot in a furnace, that the water should pass over them in a state of
vapour, that the gas formed should be collected over the water-bath,
&amp;c. In short, it is a very complicated affair. But the same effect
may be produced with the greatest facility, by the action of the Voltaic
battery, which this will give me an opportunity of exhibiting.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I am very glad of that, for I longed to see the power of this
apparatus in decomposing bodies.</p>

that wire of the battery which conveys the positive electricity; and the

other cork, so that the two wires approach each other sufficiently near

<p>It does not appear to me that you approach the wires so near as you
did when you made the battery act by itself.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Water being a better conductor of electricity than air, the two wires
will act on each other at a greater distance in the former than in the
latter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Now the electrical effect appears: I see small bubbles of air emitted
from each wire.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Each wire decomposes the water, the positive by combining with its
oxygen which is negative, the negative by combining with its hydrogen
which is positive.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">222</span>
<a name = "page222" id = "page222"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That is wonderfully curious! But what are the small bubbles of
air?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Those that appear to proceed from the positive wire, are the result
of the decomposition of the water by that wire. That is to say, the
positive electricity having combined with some of the oxygen of the
water, the particles of hydrogen which were combined with that portion
of oxygen are set at liberty, and appear in the form of small bubbles of
gas or air.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And I suppose the negative fluid having in the same manner combined
with some of the hydrogen of the water, the particles of oxygen that
were combined with it, are set free, and emitted in a gaseous form.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Precisely so. But I should not forget to observe, that the wires used
in this experiment are made of platina, a&nbsp;metal which is not
capable of combining with oxygen; for otherwise the wire would combine
with the oxygen, and the hydrogen alone would be disengaged.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">223</span>
<a name = "page223" id = "page223"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But could not water be decomposed without the electric circle being
completed? If, for instance, you immersed only the positive wire in the
water, would it not combine with the oxygen, and the hydrogen gas be
given out?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; for as you may recollect, the battery cannot act unless the
circle be completed; since the positive wire will not give out its
electricity, unless attracted by that of the negative wire.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I understand it now.&mdash;But look, Mrs. B., the decomposition of
the water which has now been going on for some time, does not sensibly
diminish its quantity&mdash;what is the reason of that?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because the quantity decomposed is so extremely small. If you compare
the density of water with that of the gases into which it is resolved,
you must be aware that a single drop of water is sufficient to produce
thousands of such small bubbles as those you now perceive.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But in this experiment, we obtain the oxygen
<span class = "pagenum">224</span>
<a name = "page224" id = "page224"> </a>
and hydrogen gases mixed together. Is there any means of procuring the
two gases separately?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They can be collected separately with great ease, by modifying a
little the experiment. Thus if instead of one tube, we employ two, as
you see here, (c,&nbsp;d, <a class = "smallcaps" href =
"#plateVIIIb">Plate VIII.</a> fig.&nbsp;<ins class = "correction" title
= "text reads ‘2,’">2.</ins>) both tubes being closed at one end, and
open at the other; and if after filling these tubes with water, we place
them standing in a glass of water&nbsp;(e), with their open end
downwards, you will see that the moment we connect the wires (a,&nbsp;b)
which proceed upwards from the interior of each tube, the one with one
end of the battery, and the other with the other end, the water in the
tubes will be decomposed; hydrogen will be given out round the wire in
the tube connected with the positive end of the battery, and oxygen in
the other; and these gases will be evolved, exactly in the proportions
which I have before mentioned, namely, two measures of hydrogen for one
of oxygen. We shall now begin the experiment, but it will be some time
before any sensible quantity of the gases can be collected.</p>

<p>The decomposition of water in this way, slow as it is, is certainly

I&nbsp;am sorry that the decomposition of water by charcoal or metals is
attended with so much inconvenience.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Water may be decomposed by means of metals without any difficulty;
but for this purpose the intervention of an acid is required. Thus, if
we add some sulphuric acid (a&nbsp;substance with the nature of which
you are not yet acquainted) to the water which the metal is to
decompose, the acid disposes the metal to combine with the oxygen of the
water so readily and abundantly, that no heat is required to hasten the
process. Of this I am going to shew you an instance. I&nbsp;put into
this bottle the water that is to be decomposed, as also the metal that
is to effect that decomposition by combining with the oxygen, and the
acid which is to facilitate the combination of the metal and the oxygen.
You will see with what violence these will act on each other.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But what metal is it that you employ for this purpose?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is iron; and it is used in the state of filings, as these present
a greater surface to the acid than a solid piece of metal. For as it is
the surface of the metal which is acted upon by the acid, and is
disposed to receive the oxygen produced by the
<span class = "pagenum">226</span>
<a name = "page226" id = "page226"> </a>
decomposition of the water, it necessarily follows that the greater is
the surface, the more considerable is the effect. The bubbles which are
now rising are hydrogen gas&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How disagreeably it smells!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is indeed unpleasant, though, I believe, not particularly hurtful.
We shall not, however, suffer any more to escape, as it will be wanted
for experiments. I&nbsp;shall, therefore, collect it in a
glass-receiver, by making it pass through this bent tube, which will
conduct it into the water-bath. (<a class = "smallcaps" href =

keep it inverted with the mouth under water, otherwise the gas would
escape. And in order that it may not be in the way, I&nbsp;introduce

be produced by such a small quantity of water, especially as oxygen is
the principal constituent of water.</p>

<p>In weight it is; but not in volume. For though the proportion, by
weight, is nearly six parts of oxygen to one of hydrogen, yet the
proportion of the volume of the gases, is about one part of oxygen to
two of hydrogen; so much heavier is the former than the latter.</p>

<a name = "page228" id = "page228"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>True: but observe that the sensible heat which is disengaged in this
operation, is not owing to the decomposition of the water, but to an
extrication of heat produced by the mixture of water and sulphuric acid.
I&nbsp;will mix some water and sulphuric acid together in this glass,
that you may feel the surprising quantity of heat that is disengaged by
their union&mdash;now take hold of the glass&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Indeed I cannot; it feels as hot as boiling water. I&nbsp;should have
imagined there would have been heat enough disengaged to have rendered
the liquid solid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>As, however, it does not produce that effect, we cannot refer this
heat to the modification called latent heat. We may, however,
I&nbsp;think, consider it as heat of capacity, as the liquid is
condensed by its loss; and if you were to repeat the experiment, in a
graduated tube, you would find that the two liquids, when mixed, occupy
considerably less space than they did separately.&mdash;But we will
reserve this to another opportunity, and attend at present to the
hydrogen gas which we have been producing.</p>

<p>If I now set the hydrogen gas, which is contained in this receiver,
at liberty all at once, and
<span class = "pagenum">229</span>
<a name = "page229" id = "page229"> </a>
kindle it as soon as it comes in contact with the atmosphere, by
presenting it to a candle, it will so suddenly and rapidly decompose the
oxygen gas, by combining with its basis, that an explosion, or a
<i>detonation</i> (as chemists commonly call it), will be produced. For
this purpose, I&nbsp;need only take up the receiver, and quickly present
its open mouth to the candle&mdash;&mdash;so . . . .</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It produced only a sort of hissing noise, with a vivid flash of
light. I&nbsp;had expected a much greater report.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And so it would have been, had the gases been closely confined at the
moment they were made to explode. If, for instance, we were to put in
this bottle a mixture of hydrogen gas and atmospheric air; and if, after
corking the bottle, we should kindle the mixture by a very small
orifice, from the sudden dilatation of the gases at the moment of their
combination, the bottle must either fly to pieces, or the cork be blown
out with considerable violence.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But in the experiment which we have just seen, if you did not kindle
the hydrogen gas, would it not equally combine with the oxygen?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">230</span>
<a name = "page230" id = "page230"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly not; for, as I have just explained to you, it is necessary
that the oxygen and hydrogen gases be burnt together, in order to
combine chemically and produce water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That is true; but I thought this was a different combination, for I
see no water produced.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The water resulting from this detonation was so small in quantity,
and in such a state of minute division, as to be invisible. But water
certainly was produced; for oxygen is incapable of combining with
hydrogen in any other proportions than those that form water; therefore
water must always be the result of their combination.</p>

<p>If, instead of bringing the hydrogen gas into sudden contact with the
atmosphere (as we did just now) so as to make the whole of it explode
the moment it is kindled, we allow but a very small surface of gas to
burn in contact with the atmosphere, the combustion goes on quietly and
gradually at the point of contact, without any detonation, because the
surfaces brought together are too small for the immediate union of
gases. The experiment is a very easy one. This phial, with a narrow
neck, (<a class = "smallcaps" href = "#plateVIIIc">Plate VIII.</a>
fig.&nbsp;5.) is full
<span class = "pagenum">231</span>
<a name = "page231" id = "page231"> </a>
of hydrogen gas, and is carefully corked. If I take out the cork without
moving the phial, and quickly approach the candle to the orifice, you
will see how different the result will&nbsp;be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>How prettily it burns, with a blue flame! The flame is gradually
sinking within the phial&mdash;now it has entirely disappeared. But does
not this combustion likewise produce water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly. In order to make the formation of the water sensible to
you, I&nbsp;shall procure a fresh supply of hydrogen gas, by putting
into this bottle (<a class = "smallcaps" href = "#plateVIIIc">Plate
VIII.</a> fig.&nbsp;6.) iron filings, water, and sulphuric acid,
materials similar to those which we have just used for the same purpose.
I&nbsp;shall then cork up the bottle, leaving only a small orifice in
the cork, with a piece of glass-tube fixed to it, through which the gas
will issue in a continued rapid stream.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I hear already the hissing of the gas through the tube, and I can
feel a strong current against my hand.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This current I am going to kindle with the candle&mdash;see how
vividly it burns&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">232</span>
<a name = "page232" id = "page232"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It burns like a candle with a long flame. But why does this
combustion last so much longer than in the former experiment?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The combustion goes on uninterruptedly as long as the new gas
continues to be produced. Now if I invert this receiver over the flame,
you will soon perceive its internal surface covered with a very fine
dew, which is pure water&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed; the glass is now quite dim with moisture! How glad I am
that we can see the water produced by this combustion.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It is exactly what I was anxious to see; for I confess I was a little
incredulous.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>If I had not held the glass-bell over the flame, the water would have
escaped in the state of vapour, as it did in the former experiment. We
have here, of course, obtained but a very small quantity of water; but
the difficulty of procuring a proper apparatus, with sufficient
quantities of
<span class = "pagenum">233</span>
<a name = "page233" id = "page233"> </a>
gases, prevents my showing it you on a larger scale.</p>

<p>The composition of water was discovered about the same period, both
by Mr. Cavendish, in this country, and by the celebrated French chemist
Lavoisier. The latter invented a very perfect and ingenious apparatus to
perform, with great accuracy, and upon a large scale, the formation of
water by the combination of oxygen and hydrogen gases. Two tubes,
conveying due proportions, the one of oxygen, the other of hydrogen gas,
are inserted at opposite sides of a large globe of glass, previously
exhausted of air; the two streams of gas are kindled within the globe,
by the electrical spark, at the point where they come in contact; they
burn together, that is to say, the hydrogen combines with the oxygen,
the caloric is set at liberty, and a quantity of water is produced
exactly equal, in weight, to that of the two gases introduced into the
globe.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And what was the greatest quantity of water ever formed in this
apparatus?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Several ounces; indeed, very nearly a pound, if I recollect right;
but the operation lasted many days.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">234</span>
<a name = "page234" id = "page234"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This experiment must have convinced all the world of the truth of the
discovery. Pray, if improper proportions of the gases were mixed and set
fire to, what would be the result?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Water would equally be formed, but there would be a residue of either
one or other of the gases, because, as I have already told you, hydrogen
and oxygen will combine only in the proportions requisite for the
formation of water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Look, Mrs. B., our experiment with the Voltaic battery (<a class =
"smallcaps" href = "#plateVIIIb">Plate VIII.</a> fig.&nbsp;2.) has made
great progress; a&nbsp;quantity of gas has been formed in each tube, but
in one of them there is twice as much gas as in the other.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; because, as I said before, water is composed of two volumes of
hydrogen to one of oxygen&mdash;and if we should now mix these gases
together and set fire to them by an electrical spark, both gases would
entirely disappear, and a small quantity of water would be formed.</p>

<p>There is another curious effect produced by the combustion of
hydrogen gas, which I shall show
<span class = "pagenum">235</span>
<a name = "page235" id = "page235"> </a>
you, though I must acquaint you first, that I cannot well explain the
cause of it. For this purpose, I&nbsp;must put some materials into our
apparatus, in order to obtain a stream of hydrogen gas, just as we have
done before. The process is already going on, and the gas is rushing
through the tube&mdash;I&nbsp;shall now kindle it with the
taper&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It burns exactly as it did before&mdash;&mdash;What is the curious
effect which you were mentioning?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Instead of the receiver, by means of which we have just seen the
drops of water form, we shall invert over the flame this piece of tube,
which is about two feet in length, and one inch in diameter (<a class =
"smallcaps" href = "#plateVIIIc">Plate VIII.</a> fig.&nbsp;7.); but you
must observe that it is open at both ends.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What a strange noise it makes! something like the Æolian harp, but
not so sweet.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is very singular, indeed; but I think rather too powerful to be
pleasing. And is not this sound accounted for?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">236</span>
<a name = "page236" id = "page236"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That the percussion of glass, by a rapid stream of gas, should
produce a sound, is not extraordinary: but the sound here is so
peculiar, that no other gas has a similar effect. Perhaps it is owing to
a brisk vibratory motion of the glass, occasioned by the successive
formation and condensation of small drops of water on the sides of the
glass tube, and the air rushing in to replace the vacuum formed.<a class

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How very much this flame resembles the burning of a candle.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The burning of a candle is produced by much the same means.
A&nbsp;great deal of hydrogen is contained in candles, whether of tallow
or wax. This hydrogen being converted into gas by the heat of the
candle, combines with the oxygen of the atmosphere, and flame and water
result from this combination. So that, in fact, the flame of a candle is
owing to the combustion of hydrogen gas. An elevation of temperature,
such as is produced by a lighted match or taper, is required to give the
first impulse to the combustion; but afterwards
<span class = "pagenum">237</span>
<a name = "page237" id = "page237"> </a>
it goes on of itself, because the candle finds a supply of caloric in
the successive quantities of heat which results from the union of the
two electricities given out by the gases during their combustion. But
there are other circumstances connected with the combustion of candles
and lamps, which I cannot explain to you till you are acquainted with
<i>carbon</i>, which is one of their constituent parts. In general,
however, whenever you see flame, you may infer that it is owing to the
formation and burning of hydrogen gas<a class = "tag" name = "tag19" id
= "tag19" href = "#note19">*</a>; for flame is the peculiar mode of
burning hydrogen gas, which, with only one or two apparent exceptions,
does not belong to any other combustible.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>You astonish me! I understood that flame was the caloric produced by
the union of the two electricities, in all combustions whatever?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Your error proceeded from your vague and incorrect idea of flame; you
have confounded it with light and caloric in general. Flame always
implies caloric, since it is produced by the combustion of hydrogen gas;
but all caloric does not
<span class = "pagenum">238</span>
<a name = "page238" id = "page238"> </a>
imply flame. Many bodies burn with intense heat without producing flame.
Coals, for instance, burn with flame until all the hydrogen which they
contain is evaporated; but when they afterwards become red hot, much
more caloric is disengaged than when they produce flame.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But the iron wire, which you burnt in oxygen gas, appeared to me to
emit flame; yet, as it was a simple metal, it could contain no
hydrogen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It produced a sparkling dazzling blaze of light, but no real
flame.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And what is the cause of the regular shape of the flame of a
candle?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The regular stream of hydrogen gas which exhales from its combustible
matter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But the hydrogen gas must, from its great levity, ascend into the
upper regions of the atmosphere; why therefore does not the flame
continue to accompany&nbsp;it?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">239</span>
<a name = "page239" id = "page239"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The combustion of the hydrogen gas is completed at the point where
the flame terminates; it then ceases to be hydrogen gas, as it is
converted by its combination with oxygen into watery vapour; but in a
state of such minute division as to be invisible.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I do not understand what is the use of the wick of a candle, since
the hydrogen gas burns so well without&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The combustible matter of the candle must be decomposed in order to
emit the hydrogen gas, and the wick is instrumental in effecting this
decomposition. Its combustion first melts the combustible matter, and .
. . .</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But in lamps the combustible matter is already fluid, and yet they
also require wicks?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I am going to add that, afterwards, the burning wick (by the power of
capillary attraction) gradually draws up the fluid to the point where
combustion
<span class = "pagenum">240</span>
<a name = "page240" id = "page240"> </a>
takes place; for you must have observed that the wick does not burn
quite to the bottom.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes; but I do not understand why it does not.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because the air has not so free an access to that part of the wick
which is immediately in contact with the candle, as to the part just
above, so that the heat there is not sufficient to produce its
decomposition; the combustion therefore begins a little above this
point.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But, Mrs. B., in those beautiful lights, called <i>gas-lights</i>,
which are now seen in many streets, and will, I&nbsp;hope, be soon
adopted every where<ins class = "correction" title = "text has .">,
</ins>I&nbsp;can perceive no wick at all. How are these lights
managed?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I am glad you have put me in mind of saying a few words on this very
useful and interesting improvement. In this mode of lighting, the gas is
conveyed to the extremity of a tube, where it is kindled, and burns as
long as the supply continues. There is, therefore, no occasion for a
wick, or any other fuel whatever.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">241</span>
<a name = "page241" id = "page241"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But how is all this gas procured in such large quantities?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is obtained from coal, by distillation.&mdash;Coal, when exposed
to heat in a close vessel, is decomposed; and hydrogen, which is one of
its constituents, rises in the state of gas, combined with another of
its component parts, carbon, forming a compound gas, called
<i>Hydrocarbonat</i>, the nature of which we shall again have an
opportunity of noticing when we treat of carbon. This gas, like
hydrogen, is perfectly transparent, invisible, and highly inflammable;
and in burning it emits that vivid light which you have so often
observed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And does the process for procuring it require nothing but heating the
coals, and conveying the gas through tubes?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Nothing else; except that the gas must be made to pass, immediately
at its formation, through two or three large vessels of water, in which
it deposits some other ingredients, and especially water, tar, and oil,
which also arise from the distillation of coals. The gas-light
apparatus, therefore, consists simply in a large iron vessel, in which
the coals are exposed to the heat of a furnace,&mdash;some reservoirs
<span class = "pagenum">242</span>
<a name = "page242" id = "page242"> </a>
of water, in which the gas deposits its impurities,&mdash;and tubes that
convey it to the desired spot, being propelled with uniform velocity
through the tubes by means of a certain degree of pressure which is made
upon the reservoir.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What an admirable contrivance! Do you not think, Mrs.&nbsp;B., that
it will soon get into universal use?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Most probably, as to the lighting of streets, offices, and public
places, as it far surpasses any former invention for that purpose; but
as to the interior of private houses, this mode of lighting has not yet
been sufficiently tried to know whether it will be found generally
desirable, either in regard to economy or convenience. It may, however,
be considered as one of the happiest applications of chemistry to the
comforts of life; and there is every reason to suppose that it will
answer the full extent of public, expectation.</p>

<p>I have another experiment to show you with hydrogen gas, which I
think will entertain you. Have you ever blown bubbles with soap and
water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes, often, when I was a child; and I used to make them float in the
air by blowing them upwards.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">243</span>
<a name = "page243" id = "page243"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We shall fill some such bubbles with hydrogen gas, instead of
atmospheric air, and you will see with what ease and rapidity they will
ascend, without the assistance of blowing, from the lightness of the
gas.&mdash;Will you mix some soap and water whilst I fill this bladder
with the gas contained in the receiver which stands on the shelf in the
water-bath?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What is the use of the brass-stopper and turn-cock at the top of the
receiver?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is to afford a passage to the gas when required. There is, you
see, a&nbsp;similar stop-cock fastened to this bladder, which is made to
fit that on the receiver. I&nbsp;screw them one on the other, and now
turn the two cocks, to open a communication between the receiver and the
bladder; then, by sliding the receiver off the shelf, and gently sinking
it into the bath, the water rises in the receiver and forces the gas
into the bladder. (<a class = "smallcaps" href = "#plateIX">Plate

<p>I think that we have already a sufficient quantity in the bladder for
our purpose; we must be careful to stop both the cocks before we
separate the bladder from the receiver, lest the gas should
escape.&mdash;Now I must fix a pipe to the stopper of the bladder, and
by dipping its mouth into the soap and water, take up a few
drops&mdash;then I again turn the cock, and squeeze the bladder in order
to force the gas into the soap and water at the mouth of the pipe. (<a

<p>There is a bubble&mdash;but it bursts before it leaves the mouth of

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>We must have patience and try again; it is not so easy to blow
bubbles by means of a bladder, as simply with the breath.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is not soap enough in the water; I&nbsp;should have had

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Does not some of the gas escape between the bladder and the pipe?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No, they are perfectly air tight; we shall succeed presently,
I&nbsp;dare say.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Now a bubble ascends; it moves with the rapidity of a balloon. How
beautifully it refracts the light!</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It has burst against the ceiling&mdash;you succeed now wonderfully;
but why do they all ascend and burst against the ceiling?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Hydrogen gas is so much lighter than atmospherical air, that it
ascends rapidly with its very light envelope, which is burst by the
force with which it strikes the ceiling.</p>

<p>Air-balloons are filled with this gas, and if they carried no other
weight than their covering, would ascend as rapidly as these
bubbles.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yet their covering must be much heavier than that of these
bubbles?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not in proportion to the quantity of gas they contain. I&nbsp;do not
know whether you have ever
<span class = "pagenum">246</span>
<a name = "page246" id = "page246"> </a>
been present at the filling of a large balloon. The apparatus for that
purpose is very simple. It consists of a number of vessels, either jars
or barrels, in which the materials for the formation of the gas are
mixed, each of these being furnished with a tube, and communicating with
a long flexible pipe, which conveys the gas into the balloon.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But the fire-balloons which were first invented, and have been since
abandoned, on account of their being so dangerous, were constructed,
I&nbsp;suppose, on a different principle.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They were filled simply with atmospherical air, considerably rarefied
by heat; and the necessity of having a fire underneath the balloon, in
order to preserve the rarefaction of the air within it, was the
circumstance productive of so much danger.</p>

<p>If you are not yet tired of experiments, I&nbsp;have another to show
you. It consists in filling soap-bubbles with a mixture of hydrogen and
oxygen gases, in the proportions that form water; and afterwards setting
fire to them.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>They will detonate, I suppose?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">247</span>

<p>Yes, they will. As you have seen the method of transferring the gas
from the receiver into the bladder, it is not necessary to repeat it.
I&nbsp;have therefore provided a bladder which contains a due proportion
of oxygen and hydrogen gases, and we have only to blow bubbles
with&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>These phenomena, however, are generally of an electrical nature. Yet
various meteorological effects may be attributed to accidental
detonations of hydrogen gas in the atmosphere; for nature abounds with
hydrogen: it constitutes a very considerable portion of the whole mass
of water belonging to our globe, and from that source almost every other
body obtains it. It enters into the composition of all animal
substances, and of a great number of minerals; but it is most abundant
in vegetables. From this immense variety of bodies, it is often
spontaneously disengaged; its great levity makes it rise into the
superior regions of the atmosphere; and when, either by an electrical
spark, or any casual elevation of temperature, it takes fire, it may
produce such meteors or luminous appearances as are occasionally seen in
the atmosphere. Of this kind are probably those broad flashes which we
often see on a summer-evening, without hearing any detonation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Every flash, I suppose, must produce a quantity of water?</p>

<p>And this water, naturally, descends in the form of rain?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That probably is often the case, though it is not a necessary
consequence; for the water may be dissolved by the atmosphere, as it
descends towards the lower regions, and remain there in the form of
clouds.</p>

<p>The application of electrical attraction to chemical phenomena is
likely to lead to many very interesting discoveries in meteorology; for
electricity evidently acts a most important part in the atmosphere. This
subject however, is, as yet, not sufficiently developed for me to
venture enlarging upon it. The phenomena of the atmosphere are far from
being well understood; and even with the little that is known, I&nbsp;am
but imperfectly acquainted.</p>


<p class = "space">
But before we take leave of hydrogen, I must not omit to mention to you
a most interesting discovery of Sir H. Davy, which is connected with
this subject.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>You allude, I suppose, to the new miner’s lamp, which has of late
been so much talked of? I&nbsp;have long been desirous of knowing what
that discovery was, and what purpose it was intended to answer.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">250</span>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It often happens in coal-mines, that quantities of the gas, called by
chemists <i>hydro-carbonat</i>, or by the miners <i>fire-damp</i>, (the
same from which the gas-lights are obtained,) ooze out from fissures in
the beds of coal, and fill the cavities in which the men are at work;
and this gas being inflammable, the consequence is, that when the men
approach those places with a lighted candle, the gas takes fire, and
explosions happen which destroy the men and horses employed in that part
of the colliery, sometimes in great numbers.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What tremendous accidents these must be! But whence does that gas
originate?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Being the chief product of the combustion of coal, no wonder that
inflammable gas should occasionally appear in situations in which this
mineral abounds, since there can be no doubt that processes of
combustion are frequently taking place at a great depth under the
surface of the earth; and therefore those accumulations of gas may arise
either from combustions actually going on, or from former combustions,
the gas having perhaps been confined there for ages.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">251</span>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And how does Sir H. Davy’s lamp prevent those dreadful
explosions?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By a contrivance equally simple and ingenious; and one which does no
less credit to the philosophical views from which it was deduced, than
to the philanthropic motives from which the enquiry sprung. The
principle of the lamp is shortly this: It was ascertained, two or three
years ago, both by Mr. Tennant and by Sir Humphry himself, that the
combustion of inflammable gas could not be propagated through small
tubes; so that if a jet of an inflammable gaseous mixture, issuing from
a bladder or any other vessel, through a small tube, be set fire to, it
burns at the orifice of the tube, but the flame never penetrates into
the vessel. It is upon this fact that Sir Humphry’s safety-lamp is
founded.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But why does not the flame ever penetrate through the tube into the
vessel from which the gas issues, so as to explode at once the whole of
the gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because, no doubt, the inflamed gas is so much cooled in its passage
through a small tube as to
<span class = "pagenum">252</span>
<a name = "page252" id = "page252"> </a>
cease to burn before the combustion reaches the reservoir.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And how can this principle be applied to the construction of a
lamp?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Nothing easier. You need only suppose a lamp enclosed all round in
glass or horn, but having a number of small open tubes at the bottom,
and others at the top, to let the air in and out. Now, if such a lamp or
lanthorn be carried into an atmosphere capable of exploding, an
explosion or combustion of the gas will take place within the lamp; and
although the vent afforded by the tubes will save the lamp from
bursting, yet, from the principle just explained, the combustion will
not be propagated to the external air through the tubes, so that no
farther consequence will ensue.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And is that all the mystery of that valuable lamp?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; in the early part of the enquiry a lamp of this kind was actually
proposed; but it was but a rude sketch compared to its present state of
improvement. Sir H. Davy, after a succession of trials, by which he
brought his lamp nearer and nearer
<span class = "pagenum">253</span>
<a name = "page253" id = "page253"> </a>
to perfection, at last conceived the happy idea that if the lamp were
surrounded with a wire-work or wire-gauze, of a close texture, instead
of glass or horn, the tubular contrivance I have just described would be
entirely superseded, since each of the interstices of the gauze would
act as a tube in preventing the propagation of explosions; so that this
pervious metallic covering would answer the various purposes of
transparency, of permeability to air, and of protection against
explosion. This idea, Sir Humphry immediately submitted to the test of
experiment, and the result has answered his most sanguine expectations,
both in his laboratory and in the collieries, where it has already been
extensively tried. And he has now the happiness of thinking that his
invention will probably be the means of saving every year a number of
lives, which would have been lost in digging out of the bowels of the
earth one of the most valuable necessaries of life. Here is one of these
lamps, every part of which you will at once comprehend. (See <a class =

<p>How very simple and ingenious! But I do not yet well see why an
explosion taking place within the lamp should not communicate to the
external air around it, through the interstices of the wire?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">254</span>
<a name = "page254" id = "page254"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This has been and is still a subject of wonder, even to philosophers;
and the only mode they have of explaining it is, that flame or ignition
cannot pass through a fine wire-work, because the metallic wire cools
the flame sufficiently to extinguish it in passing through the gauze.
This property of the wire-gauze is quite similar to that of the tubes
which I mentioned on introducing the subject; for you may consider each
interstice of the gauze as an extremely short tube of a very small
diameter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But I should expect the wire would often become red-hot, by the
burning of the gas within the lamp?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>And this is actually the case, for the top of the lamp is very apt to
become red-hot. But, fortunately, inflammable gaseous mixtures cannot be
exploded by red-hot wire, the intervention of actual flame being
required for that purpose; so that the wire does not set fire to the
explosive gas around&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I can understand that; but if the wire be red-hot, how can it cool
the flame within, and prevent its passing through the gauze?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">255</span>
<a name = "page255" id = "page255"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The gauze, though red-hot, is not so hot as the flame by which it has
been heated; and as metallic wire is a good conductor, the heat does not
much accumulate in it, as it passes off quickly to the other parts of
the lamp, as well as to any contiguous bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

once the immense utility with which science may be practically applied
to some of the most important purposes.</p>

<p>Yes, it is; and you therefore already know that <ins class = "mycorr"
title = "text reads ‘sulpur’">sulphur</ins> is a very combustible
substance. It is seldom discovered in nature in a pure unmixed state; so
great is its affinity for other substances, that it is almost constantly
found combined with some of them. It is most commonly united with
<span class = "pagenum">257</span>
<a name = "page257" id = "page257"> </a>
metals, under various forms, and is separated from them by a very simple
process. It exists likewise in many mineral waters, and some vegetables
yield it in various proportions, especially those of the cruciform
tribe. It is also found in animal matter; in short, it may be discovered
in greater or less quantity, in the mineral, vegetable, and animal
kingdoms.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I have heard of <i>flowers of sulphur</i>, are they the produce of
any plant?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By no means: they consist of nothing more than common sulphur,
reduced to a very fine powder by a process called
<i>sublimation</i>.&mdash;You see some of it in this phial; it is
exactly the same substance as this lump of sulphur, only its colour is a
paler yellow, owing to its state of very minute division.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray what is sublimation?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is the evaporation, or, more properly speaking, the volatilisation
of solid substances, which, in cooling, condense again in a concrete
form.
<span class = "pagenum">258</span>
<a name = "page258" id = "page258"> </a>
The process, in this instance, must be performed in a closed vessel,
both to prevent combustion, which would take place if the access of air
were not carefully precluded, and likewise in order to collect the
substance after the operation. As it is rather a slow process, we shall
not try the experiment now; but you will understand it perfectly if I
show you the apparatus used for the purpose. (<a class = "smallcaps"
href = "#plateXI">Plate XI.</a> fig.&nbsp;1.) Some lumps of sulphur are
put into a receiver of this kind, which is called a <i>cucurbit</i>. Its
shape, you see, somewhat resembles that of a pear, and is open at the
top, so as to adapt itself exactly to a kind of conical receiver of this
sort, called the head. The cucurbit, thus covered with its head, is
placed over a sand-bath; this is nothing more than a vessel full of
sand, which is kept heated by a furnace, such as you see here, so as to
preserve the apparatus in a moderate and uniform temperature. The
sulphur then soon begins to melt, and immediately after this,
a&nbsp;thick white smoke rises, which is gradually deposited within the
head, or upper part of the apparatus, where it condenses against the
sides, somewhat in the form of a vegetation, whence it has obtained the
name of flowers of sulphur. This apparatus, which is called an
<i>alembic</i>, is highly useful in all kinds of distillations, as you
will see when we come to treat of those operations. Alembics are not
commonly
<span class = "pagenum">259</span>
<a name = "page259" id = "page259"> </a>
made of glass, like this, which is applicable only to distillations upon
a very small scale. Those used in manufactures are generally made of
copper, and are, of course, considerably larger. The principal
construction, however, is always the same, although their shape admits
of some variation.</p>

<p>What is the use of that neck, or tube, which bends down from the
upper piece of the apparatus?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is of no use in sublimations; but in distillations (the general
object of which is to evaporate, by heat, in closed vessels, the
volatile parts of a compound body, and to condense them again into a
liquid,) it serves to carry off the condensed fluid, which otherwise
would fall back into the cucurbit. But this is rather foreign to our
present subject. Let us return to the sulphur. You now perfectly
understand, I&nbsp;suppose, what is meant by sublimation?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I believe I do. Sublimation appears to consist in destroying, by
means of heat, the attraction of aggregation of the particles of a solid
body, which are thus volatilised; and as soon as they lose the
<span class = "pagenum">260</span>
<a name = "page260" id = "page260"> </a>
caloric which produced that effect, they are deposited in the form of a
fine powder.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It seems to me to be somewhat similar to the transformation of water
into vapour, which returns to its liquid state when deprived of
caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>There is this difference, however, that the sulphur does not return
to its former state, since, instead of lumps, it changes to a fine
powder.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Chemically speaking, it is exactly the same substance, whether in the
form of lump or powder. For if this powder be melted again by heat, it
will, in cooling, be restored to the same solid state in which it was
before its sublimation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But if there be no real change, produced by the sublimation of the
sulphur, what is the use of that operation?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It divides the sulphur into very minute parts, and thus disposes it
to enter more readily into combination with other bodies. It is used
also as a means of purification.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">261</span>
<a name = "page261" id = "page261"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Sublimation appears to me like the beginning of combustion, for the
completion of which one circumstance only is wanting, the absorption of
oxygen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But that circumstance is every thing. No essential alteration is
produced in sulphur by sublimation; whilst in combustion it combines
with the oxygen, and forms a new compound totally different in every
respect from sulphur in its pure state.&mdash;We shall now <i>burn</i>
some sulphur, and you will see how very different the result will be.
For this purpose I put a small quantity of flowers of sulphur into this
cup, and place it in a dish, into which I have poured a little water:
I&nbsp;now set fire to the sulphur with the point of this hot wire; for
its combustion will not begin unless its temperature be considerably
raised.&mdash;You see that it burns with a faint blueish flame; and as I
invert over it this receiver, white fumes arise from the sulphur, and
fill the vessel.&mdash;You will soon perceive that the water is rising
within the receiver, a&nbsp;little above its level in the
plate.&mdash;Well, Emily, can you account for this?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I suppose that the sulphur has absorbed the oxygen from the
atmospherical air within the receiver, and that we shall find some
oxygenated
<span class = "pagenum">262</span>
<a name = "page262" id = "page262"> </a>
sulphur in the cup. As for the white smoke, I&nbsp;am quite at a loss to
guess what it may&nbsp;be.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Your first conjecture is very right: but you are mistaken in the
last; for nothing will be left in the cup. The white vapour is the
oxygenated sulphur, which assumes the form of an elastic fluid of a
pungent and offensive smell, and is a powerful acid. Here you see a
chemical combination of oxygen and sulphur, producing a true gas, which
would continue such under the pressure and at the temperature of the
atmosphere, if it did not unite with the water in the plate, to which it
imparts its acid taste, and all its acid properties.&mdash;You see, now,
with what curious effects the combustion of sulphur is attended.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This is something quite new; and I confess that I do not perfectly
understand why the sulphur turns acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is because it unites with oxygen, which is the acidifying
principle. And, indeed, the word <i>oxygen</i> is derived from two Greek
words signifying <i>to produce an acid</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Why, then, is not water, which contains such a quantity of oxygen,
acid?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">263</span>
<a name = "page263" id = "page263"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because hydrogen, which is the other constituent of water, is not
susceptible of acidification.&mdash;I&nbsp;believe it will be necessary,
before we proceed further, to say a few words of the general nature of
acids, though it is rather a deviation from our plan of examining the
simple bodies separately, before we consider them in a state of
combination.</p>

<p>Acids may be considered as a peculiar class of <i>burnt</i> bodies,
which during their combustion, or combination with oxygen, have acquired
very characteristic properties. They are chiefly discernible by their
sour taste, and by turning red most of the blue vegetable colours. These
two properties are common to the whole class of acids; but each of them
is distinguished by other peculiar qualities. Every acid consists of
some particular substance, (which constitutes its basis, and is
different in each,) and of oxygen, which is common to them all.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But I do not clearly see the difference between acids and oxyds.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Acids were, in fact, oxyds, which, by the addition of a sufficient
quantity of oxygen, have been converted into acids. For acidification,
you must observe, always implies previous oxydation, as a body must have
combined with the quantity of
<span class = "pagenum">264</span>
<a name = "page264" id = "page264"> </a>
oxygen requisite to constitute it an oxyd, before it can combine with
the greater quantity that is necessary to render it an acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Are all oxyds capable of being converted into acids?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very far from it; it is only certain substances which will enter into
that peculiar kind of union with oxygen that produces acids, and the
number of these is proportionally very small; but all burnt bodies may
be considered as belonging either to the class of oxyds, or to that of
acids. At a future period, we shall enter more at large into this
subject. At present, I&nbsp;have but one circumstance further to point
out to your observation respecting acids: it is, that most of them are
susceptible of two degrees of acidification, according to the different
quantities of oxygen with which their basis combines.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And how are these two degrees of acidification distinguished?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By the peculiar properties which result from them. The acid we have
just made is the first or weakest degree of acidification, and is called
<i>sulphureous acid</i>; if it were fully saturated with oxygen,
<span class = "pagenum">265</span>
<a name = "page265" id = "page265"> </a>
it would be called <i>sulphuric acid</i>. You must therefore remember,
that in this, as in all acids, the first degree of acidification is
expressed by the termination in <i>ous</i>; the stronger, by the
termination in <i>ic</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And how is the sulphuric acid made?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By burning sulphur in pure oxygen gas, and thus rendering its
combustion much more complete. I&nbsp;have provided some oxygen gas for
this purpose; it is in that bottle, but we must first decant the gas
into the glass receiver which stands on the shelf in the bath, and is
full of water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Pray, let me try to do it, Mrs. B.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It requires some little dexterity&mdash;hold the bottle completely
under water, and do not turn the mouth upwards, till it is immediately
under the aperture in the shelf, through which the gas is to pass into
the receiver, and then turn it up gradually.&mdash;Very well, you have
only let a few bubbles escape, and that must be expected at a first
trial.&mdash;Now I shall put this piece of sulphur into the receiver,
through the opening at the top, and
<span class = "pagenum">266</span>
<a name = "page266" id = "page266"> </a>
introduce along with it a small piece of lighted tinder to set fire to
it.&mdash;This requires being done very quickly, lest the atmospherical
air should get in, and mix with the pure oxygen gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>How beautifully it burns!</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But it is already buried in the thick vapour. This, I&nbsp;suppose,
is sulphuric acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Are these acids always in a gaseous state?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Sulphureous acid, as we have already observed, is a permanent gas,
and can be obtained in a liquid form only by condensing it in water. In
its pure state, the sulphureous acid is invisible, and it now appears in
the form of a white smoke, from its combining with the moisture. But the
vapour of sulphuric acid, which you have just seen to rise during the
combustion, is not a gas, but only a vapour, which condenses into liquid
sulphuric acid, by losing its caloric. But it appears from Sir H. Davy’s
experiments, that this formation and condensation of sulphuric acid
requires the presence of water, for which purpose the vapour is received
<span class = "pagenum">267</span>
<a name = "page267" id = "page267"> </a>
into cold water, which may afterwards be separated from the acid by
evaporation.</p>

<p>Sulphur has hitherto been considered as a simple substance; but Sir
H. Davy has suspected that it contains a small portion of hydrogen, and
perhaps also of oxygen.</p>

<p>On submitting sulphur to the action of the Voltaic battery, he
observed that the negative wire gave out hydrogen; and the existence of
hydrogen in sulphur was rendered still more probable by his observing
that a small quantity of water was produced during the combustion of
sulphur.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And pray of what nature is sulphur when perfectly pure?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Sulphur has probably never been obtained perfectly free from
combination, so that its radical may possibly possess properties very
different from those of common sulphur. It has been suspected to be of a
metallic nature; but this is mere conjecture.</p>

<p>Before we quit the subject of sulphur, I must tell you that it is
susceptible of combining with a great variety of substances, and
especially with hydrogen, with which you are already acquainted.
Hydrogen gas can dissolve a small portion of&nbsp;it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">268</span>
<a name = "page268" id = "page268"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What! can a gas dissolve a solid substance?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; a solid substance may be so minutely divided by heat, as to
become soluble in a gas: and there are several instances of it. But you
must observe, that, in this case, a&nbsp;chemical union or combination
of the sulphur with the hydrogen gas is produced. In order to effect
this, the sulphur must be strongly heated in contact with the gas; the
heat reduces the sulphur to such a state of extreme division, and
diffuses it so thoroughly through the gas, that they combine and
incorporate together. And as a proof that there must be a chemical union
between the sulphur and the gas, it is sufficient to remark that they
are not separated when the sulphur loses the caloric by which it was
volatilized. Besides, it is evident, from the peculiar fetid smell of
this gas, that it is a new compound totally different from either of its
constituents; it is called <i>sulphuretted hydrogen gas</i>, and is
contained in great abundance in sulphureous mineral waters.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Are not the Harrogate waters of this nature?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; they are naturally impregnated with sulphuretted
<span class = "pagenum">269</span>
<a name = "page269" id = "page269"> </a>
hydrogen gas, and there are many other springs of the same kind, which
shows that this gas must often be formed in the bowels of the earth by
spontaneous processes of nature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And could not such waters be made artificially by impregnating common
water with this gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; they can be so well imitated, as perfectly to resemble the
Harrogate waters.</p>

<p>Sulphur combines likewise with phosphorus, and with the alkalies, and
alkaline earths, substances with which you are yet unacquainted. We
cannot, therefore, enter into these combinations at present. In our next
lesson we shall treat of phosphorus.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>May we not begin that subject to-day; this lesson has been so
short?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I have no objection, if you are not tired. What do you say,
Caroline?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I am as desirous as Emily of prolonging the lesson to-day, especially
as we are to enter on a new
<span class = "pagenum">270</span>
<a name = "page270" id = "page270"> </a>
subject; for I confess that sulphur has not appeared to me so
interesting as the other simple bodies.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Perhaps you may find phosphorus more entertaining. You must not,
however, be discouraged when you meet with some parts of a study less
amusing than others; it would answer no good purpose to select the most
pleasing parts, since, if we did not proceed with some method, in order
to acquire a general idea of the whole, we could scarcely expect to take
interest in any particular subjects.</p>


<h5 class = "section">PHOSPHORUS.</h5>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Phosphorus</span> is considered as a simple
body; though, like sulphur, it has been suspected of containing
hydrogen. It was not known by the earlier chemists. It was first
discovered by Brandt, a&nbsp;chemist of Hamburgh, whilst employed in
researches after the philosopher’s stone; but the method of obtaining it
remained a secret till it was a second time discovered both by Kunckel
and Boyle, in the year 1680. You see a specimen of phosphorus in this
phial; it is generally moulded into small sticks of a yellowish colour,
as you find it here.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">271</span>
<a name = "page271" id = "page271"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I do not understand in what the discovery consisted; there may be a
secret method of making an artificial composition, but how can you talk
of <i>making</i> a substance which naturally exists?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>A body may exist in nature so closely combined with other substances,
as to elude the observation of chemists, or render it extremely
difficult to obtain it in its separate state. This is the case with
phosphorus, which is always so intimately combined with other
substances, that its existence remained unnoticed till Brandt discovered
the means of obtaining it free from other combinations. It is found in
all animal substances, and is now chiefly extracted from bones, by a
chemical process. It exists also in some plants, that bear a strong
analogy to animal matter in their chemical composition.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But is it never found in its pure separate state?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Never, and this is the reason that it has remained so long
undiscovered.</p>

<p>Phosphorus is eminently combustible; it melts and takes fire at the
temperature of one hundred
<span class = "pagenum">272</span>
<a name = "page272" id = "page272"> </a>
degrees, and absorbs in its combustion nearly once and a half its own
weight of oxygen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What! will a pound of phosphorus consume a pound and half of
oxygen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>So it appears from accurate experiments. I&nbsp;can show you with
what violence it combines with oxygen, by burning some of it in that
gas. We must manage the experiment in the same manner as we did the
combustion of sulphur. You see I am obliged to cut this little bit of
phosphorus under water, otherwise there would be danger of its taking
fire by the heat of my fingers. I&nbsp;now <ins class = "mycorr" title =
"missing ‘it’?">put into</ins> the receiver, and kindle it by means of a
hot wire.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What a blaze! I&nbsp;can hardly look at it. I never saw any thing so
brilliant. Does it not hurt your eyes, Caroline?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes; but still I cannot help looking at it. A&nbsp;prodigious
quantity of oxygen must indeed be absorbed, when so much light and
caloric are disengaged!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">273</span>
<a name = "page273" id = "page273"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>In the combustion of a pound of phosphorus, a&nbsp;sufficient
quantity of caloric is set free to melt upwards of a hundred pounds of
ice; this has been computed by direct experiments with the
calorimeter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And is the result of this combustion, like that of sulphur, an
acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; phosphoric acid. And had we duly proportioned the phosphorus and
the oxygen, they would have been completely converted into phosphoric
acid, weighing together, in this new state, exactly the sum of their
weights separately. The water would have ascended into the receiver, on
account of the vacuum formed, and would have filled it entirely. In this
case, as in the combustion of sulphur, the acid vapour formed is
absorbed and condensed in the water of the receiver. But when this
combustion is performed without any water or moisture being present, the
acid then appears in the form of concrete whitish flakes, which are,
however, extremely ready to melt upon the least admission of
moisture.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Does phosphorus, in burning in atmospherical
<span class = "pagenum">274</span>
<a name = "page274" id = "page274"> </a>
air, produce, like sulphur, a&nbsp;weaker sort of the same acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No: for it burns in atmospherical air, nearly at the same temperature
as in pure oxygen gas; and it is in both cases so strongly disposed to
combine with the oxygen, that the combustion is perfect, and the product
similar; only in atmospherical air, being less rapidly supplied with
oxygen, the process is performed in a slower manner.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But is there no method of acidifying phosphorus in a slighter manner,
so as to form <i>phosphorus</i> acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, there is. When simply exposed to the atmosphere, phosphorus
undergoes a kind of slow combustion at any temperature above zero.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But is not the process in this case rather an oxydation than a
combustion? For if the oxygen is too slowly absorbed for a sensible
quantity of light and heat to be disengaged, it is not a true
combustion.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The case is not as you suppose: a faint light is
<span class = "pagenum">275</span>
<a name = "page275" id = "page275"> </a>
emitted which is very discernible in the dark; but the heat evolved is
not sufficiently strong to be sensible: a&nbsp;whitish vapour arises
from this combustion, which, uniting with water, condenses into liquid
phosphorus acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is it not very singular that phosphorus should burn at so low a
temperature in atmospherical air, whilst it does not burn in pure oxygen
without the application of heat?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>So it at first appears. But this circumstance seems to be owing to
the nitrogen gas of the atmosphere. This gas dissolves small particles
of phosphorus, which being thus minutely divided and diffused in the
atmospherical air, combines with the oxygen, and undergoes this slow
combustion. But the same effect does not take place in oxygen gas,
because it is not capable of dissolving phosphorus; it is therefore
necessary, in this case, that heat should be applied to effect that
division of particles, which, in the former instance, is produced by the
nitrogen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I have seen letters written with phosphorus, which are invisible by
day-light, but may be read
<span class = "pagenum">276</span>
<a name = "page276" id = "page276"> </a>
in the dark by their own light. They look as if they were written with
fire; yet they do not seem to burn.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But they do really burn; for it is by their slow combustion that the
light is emitted; and phosphorus acid is the result of this
combustion.</p>

<p>Phosphorus is sometimes used as a test to estimate the purity of
atmospherical air. For this purpose, it is burnt in a graduated tube,
called an <i>Eudiometer</i> (<a class = "smallcaps" href =
"#plateXI">Plate XI.</a> fig.&nbsp;2.), and from the quantity of air
which the phosphorus absorbs, the proportion of oxygen in the air
examined is deduced; for the phosphorus will absorb all the oxygen, and
the nitrogen alone will remain.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And the more oxygen is contained in the atmosphere, the purer,
I&nbsp;suppose, it is esteemed?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly. Phosphorus, when melted, combines with a great variety of
substances. With sulphur it forms a compound so extremely combustible,
that it immediately takes fire on coming in contact with the air. It is
with this composition that phosphoric matches are prepared, which kindle
as soon as they are taken out of their case and are exposed to the
air.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">277</span>
<a name = "page277" id = "page277"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I have a box of these curious matches; but I have observed, that in
very cold weather, they will not take fire without being previously
rubbed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By rubbing them you raise their temperature; for, you know, friction
is one of the means of extricating heat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Will phosphorus combine with hydrogen gas, as sulphur does?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; and the compound gas which results from this combination has a
smell still more fetid than the sulphuretted hydrogen; it resembles that
of garlic.</p>

<p>The <i>phosphoretted hydrogen gas</i> has this remarkable
peculiarity, that it takes fire spontaneously in the atmosphere, at any
temperature. It is thus, probably, that are produced those transient
flames, or flashes of light, called by the vulgar <i>Will-of-the
Whisp</i>, or more properly <i>Ignes-fatui</i>, which are often seen in
church-yards, and places where the putrefactions of animal matter exhale
phosphorus and hydrogen gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Country people, who are so much frightened by
<span class = "pagenum">278</span>
<a name = "page278" id = "page278"> </a>
those appearances, would soon be reconciled to them, if they knew from
what a simple cause they proceed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There are other combinations of phosphorus that have also very
singular properties, particularly that which results from its union with
lime.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is there any name to distinguish the combination of two substances,
like phosphorus and lime, neither of which are oxygen, and which cannot
therefore produce either an oxyd or an acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The names of such combinations are composed from those of their
ingredients, merely by a slight change in their termination. Thus the
combination of sulphur with lime is called a <i>sulphuret</i>, and that
of phosphorus, a&nbsp;<i>phosphuret of lime</i>. This latter compound,
I&nbsp;was going to say, has the singular property of decomposing water,
merely by being thrown into it. It effects this by absorbing the oxygen
of water, in consequence of which bubbles of hydrogen gas ascend,
holding in solution a small quantity of phosphorus.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">279</span>
<a name = "page279" id = "page279"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>These bubbles then are <i>phosphoretted hydrogen gas</i>?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; and they produce the singular appearance of a flash of fire
issuing from water, as the bubbles kindle and detonate on the surface of
the water, at the instant that they come in contact with the
atmosphere.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is not this effect nearly similar to that produced by the combination
of phosphorus and sulphur, or, more properly speaking, the <i>phosphuret
of sulphur</i>?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but the phenomenon appears more extraordinary in this case, from
the presence of water, and from the gaseous form of the combustible
compound. Besides, the experiment surprises by its great simplicity. You
only throw a piece of phosphoret of lime into a glass of water, and
bubbles of fire will immediately issue from&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Cannot we try the experiment?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">280</span>
<a name = "page280" id = "page280"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very easily: but we must do it in the open air; for the smell of the
phosphorated hydrogen gas is so extremely fetid, that it would be
intolerable in the house. But before we leave the room, we may produce,
by another process, some bubbles of the same gas, which are much less
offensive.</p>

<p>There is in this little glass retort a solution of potash in water;
I&nbsp;add to it a small piece of phosphorus. We must now heat the
retort over the lamp, after having engaged its neck under
water&mdash;you see it begins to boil; in a few minutes bubbles will
appear, which take fire and detonate as they issue from the water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>There is one&mdash;and another. How curious it is!&mdash;But I do not
understand how this is produced.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is the consequence of a display of affinities too complicated,
I&nbsp;fear, to be made perfectly intelligible to you at present.</p>

<p>In a few words, the reciprocal action of the potash, phosphorus,
caloric, and water are such, that some of the water is decomposed, and
the hydrogen gas thereby formed carries off some minute particles of
phosphorus, with which it forms phosphoretted
<span class = "pagenum">281</span>

hydrogen gas, a&nbsp;compound which spontaneously takes fire at almost
any temperature.</p>

<p>What is that circular ring of smoke which slowly rises from each
bubble after its detonation<ins class = "mycorr" title = "text has .">?&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>It consists of water and phosphoric acid in vapour, which are

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =

learn the nature and properties of <span class =
"smallroman">CARBON</span>. This substance is quite new to me;
I&nbsp;never heard it mentioned before.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not so new as you imagine; for carbon is nothing more than charcoal
in a state of purity, that is to say, unmixed with any foreign
ingredients.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But charcoal is made by art, Mrs. B., and a body consisting of one
simple substance cannot be fabricated?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You again confound the idea, of making a simple body, with that of
separating it from a compound. The chemical processes by which a simple
body is obtained in a state of purity, consist in <i>unmaking</i> the
compound in which it is contained,
<span class = "pagenum">283</span>
<a name = "page283" id = "page283"> </a>
in order to separate from it the simple substance in question. The
method by which charcoal is usually obtained, is, indeed, commonly
called <i>making</i> it; but, upon examination, you will find this
process to consist simply in separating it from other substances with
which it is found combined in nature.</p>

<p>Carbon forms a considerable part of the solid matter of all organised
bodies; but it is most abundant in the vegetable creation, and it is
chiefly obtained from wood. When the oil and water (which are other
constituents of vegetable matter) are evaporated, the black, porous,
brittle substance that remains, is charcoal.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But if heat be applied to the wood in order to evaporate the oil and
water, will not the temperature of the charcoal be raised so as to make
it burn; and if it combines with oxygen, can we any longer call it
pure?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I was going to say, that, in this operation, the air must be
excluded.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How then can the vapour of the oil and water fly off?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">284</span>
<a name = "page284" id = "page284"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>In order to produce charcoal in its purest state (which is, even
then, but a less imperfect sort of carbon), the operation should be
performed in an earthen retort. Heat being applied to the body of the
retort, the evaporable part of the wood will escape through its neck,
into which no air can penetrate as long as the heated vapour continues
to fill it. And if it be wished to collect these volatile products of
the wood, this can easily be done by introducing the neck of the retort
into the water-bath apparatus, with which you are acquainted. But the
preparation of common charcoal, such as is used in kitchens and
manufactures, is performed on a much larger scale, and by an easier and
less expensive process.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I have seen the process of making common charcoal. The wood is ranged
on the ground in a pile of a pyramidical form, with a fire underneath;
the whole is then covered with clay, a&nbsp;few holes only being left
for the circulation of air.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>These holes are closed as soon as the wood is fairly lighted, so that
the combustion is checked, or at least continues but in a very imperfect
manner; but the heat produced by it is sufficient to
<span class = "pagenum">285</span>
<a name = "page285" id = "page285"> </a>
force out and volatilize, through the earthy cover, most part of the
oily and watery principles of the wood, although it cannot reduce it to
ashes.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is pure carbon as black as charcoal?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The purest charcoal we can prepare is so; but chemists have never yet
been able to separate it entirely from hydrogen. Sir H. Davy says, that
the most perfect carbon that is prepared by art contains about five per
cent. of hydrogen; he is of opinion, that if we could obtain it quite
free from foreign ingredients, it would be metallic, in common with
other simple substances.</p>

<p>But there is a form in which charcoal appears, that I dare say will
surprise you.&mdash;This ring, which I wear on my finger, owes its
brilliancy to a small piece of carbon.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Surely, you are jesting, Mrs. B.?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I thought your ring was diamond?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That is astonishing! Is it possible to see two things apparently more

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, curious to think that we adorn ourselves with jewels
of charcoal!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There are many other substances, consisting chiefly of carbon, that
are remarkably white. Cotton, for instance, is almost wholly carbon.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That, I&nbsp;own, I could never have imagined!&mdash;But pray,
Mrs.&nbsp;B., since it is known of what substance diamond and cotton are
composed, why should they not be manufactured, or imitated, by some
chemical process, which would render them much cheaper, and more
plentiful than the present mode of obtaining them?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You might as well, my dear, propose that we should make flowers and
fruit, nay, perhaps even animals, by a chemical process; for it is known
of what these bodies consist, since every thing which we are acquainted
with in nature is formed from the various simple substances that we have
<span class = "pagenum">287</span>
<a name = "page287" id = "page287"> </a>
enumerated. But you must not suppose that a knowledge of the component
parts of a body will in every case enable us to imitate it. It is much
less difficult to decompose bodies, and discover of what materials they
are made, than it is to recompose them. The first of these processes is
called <i>analysis</i>, the last <i>synthesis</i>. When we are able to
ascertain the nature of a substance by both these methods, so that the
result of one confirms that of the other, we obtain the most complete
knowledge of it that we are capable of acquiring. This is the case with
water, with the atmosphere, with most of the oxyds, acids, and neutral
salts, and with many other compounds. But the more complicated
combinations of nature, even in the mineral kingdom, are in general
beyond our reach, and any attempt to imitate organised bodies must ever
prove fruitless; their formation is a secret that rests in the bosom of
the Creator. You see, therefore, how vain it would be to attempt to make
cotton by chemical means. But, surely, we have no reason to regret our
inability in this instance, when nature has so clearly pointed out a
method of obtaining it in perfection and abundance.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I did not imagine that the principle of life could be imitated by the
aid of chemistry; but it did not appear to me ridiculous to suppose that
chemists
<span class = "pagenum">288</span>
<a name = "page288" id = "page288"> </a>
might attain a perfect imitation of inanimate nature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They have succeeded in this point in a variety of instances; but, as
you justly observe, the principle of life, or even the minute and
intimate organisation of the vegetable kingdom, are secrets that have
almost entirely eluded the researches of philosophers; nor do I imagine
that human art will ever be capable of investigating them with complete
success.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But diamond, since it consists of one simple unorganised substance,
might be, one would think, perfectly imitable by art?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is sometimes as much beyond our power to obtain a simple body in a
state of perfect purity, as it is to imitate a complicated combination;
for the operations by which nature separates bodies are frequently as
inimitable as those which she uses for their combination. This is the
case with carbon; all the efforts of chemists to separate it entirely
from other substances have been fruitless, and in the purest state in
which it can be obtained by art, it still retains a portion of hydrogen,
and probably of some other foreign ingredients. We are ignorant
<span class = "pagenum">289</span>
<a name = "page289" id = "page289"> </a>
of the means which nature employs to crystallize it. It may probably be
the work of ages, to purify, arrange, and unite the particles of carbon
in the form of diamond. Here is some charcoal in the purest state we can
procure it: you see that it is a very black, brittle, light, porous
substance, entirely destitute of either taste or smell. Heat, without
air, produces no alteration in it, as it is not volatile; but, on the
contrary, it invariably remains at the bottom of the vessel after all
the other parts of the vegetable are evaporated.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yet carbon is, no doubt, combustible, since you say that charcoal
would absorb oxygen if air were admitted during its preparation?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Unquestionably. Besides, you know, Emily, how much it is used in
cooking. But pray what is the reason that charcoal burns without smoke,
whilst a wood fire smokes so much?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because, in the conversion of wood into charcoal, the volatile
particles of the former have been evaporated.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yet I have frequently seen charcoal burn with
<span class = "pagenum">290</span>
<a name = "page290" id = "page290"> </a>
flame; therefore it must, in that case, contain some hydrogen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very true; but you must recollect that charcoal, especially that
which is used for common purposes, is not perfectly pure. It generally
retains some remains of the various other component parts of vegetables,
and hydrogen particularly, which accounts for the flame in question.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But what becomes of the carbon itself during its combustion?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It gradually combines with the oxygen of the atmosphere, in the same
way as sulphur and phosphorus, and, like those substances, it is
converted into a peculiar acid, which flies off in a gaseous form. There
is this difference, however, that the acid is not, in this instance, as
in the two cases just mentioned, a&nbsp;mere condensable vapour, but a
permanent elastic fluid, which always remains in the state of gas, under
any pressure and at any temperature. The nature of this acid was first
ascertained by Dr. Black, of Edinburgh; and, before the introduction of
the new nomenclature, it was called <i>fixed air</i>. It is now
distinguished by the more appropriate name of <i>carbonic acid
gas</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">291</span>
<a name = "page291" id = "page291"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Carbon, then, can be volatilized by burning, though, by heat alone,
no such effect is produced?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but then it is no longer simple carbon, but an acid of which
carbon forms the basis. In this state, carbon retains no more appearance
of solidity or corporeal form, than the basis of any other gas. And you
may, I&nbsp;think, from this instance, derive a more clear idea of the
basis of the oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen gases, the existence of
which, as real bodies, you seemed to doubt, because they were not to be
obtained simply in a solid form.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That is true; we may conceive the basis of the oxygen, and of the
other gases, to be solid, heavy substances, like carbon; but so much
expanded by caloric as to become invisible.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But does not the carbonic acid gas partake of the blackness of
charcoal?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not in the least. Blackness, you know, does not appear to be
essential to carbon, and it is pure carbon, and not charcoal, that we
must consider
<span class = "pagenum">292</span>
<a name = "page292" id = "page292"> </a>
as the basis of carbonic acid. We shall make some carbonic acid, and, in
order to hasten the process, we shall burn the carbon in oxygen gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But do you mean then to burn diamond?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Charcoal will answer the purpose still better, being softer and more
easy to inflame; besides the experiments on diamond are rather
expensive.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But is it possible to burn diamond?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, it is; and in order to effect this combustion, nothing more is
required than to apply a sufficient degree of heat by means of the
blow-pipe, and of a stream of oxygen gas. Indeed it is by burning
diamond that its chemical nature has been ascertained. It has long been
known as a combustible substance, but it is within these few years only
that the product of its combustion has been proved to be pure carbonic
acid. This remarkable discovery is due to Mr. Tennant.</p>

<p>Now let us try to make some carbonic acid.&mdash;Will you, Emily,
decant some oxygen gas from this large jar into the receiver in which we
are to
<span class = "pagenum">293</span>
<a name = "page293" id = "page293"> </a>
<ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘bnrn’">burn</ins> the carbon;
and I shall introduce this small piece of charcoal, with a little
lighted tinder, which will be necessary to give the first impulse to the
combustion.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I cannot conceive how so small a piece of tinder, and that but just
lighted, can raise the temperature of the carbon sufficiently to set
fire to it; for it can produce scarcely any sensible heat, and it hardly
touches the carbon.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The tinder thus kindled has only heat enough to begin its own
combustion, which, however, soon becomes so rapid in the oxygen gas, as
to raise the temperature of the charcoal sufficiently for this to burn
likewise, as you see is now the case.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I am surprised that the combustion of carbon is not more brilliant;
it does not give out near so much light or caloric as phosphorus, or
sulphur. Yet since it combines with so much oxygen, why is not a
proportional quantity of light and heat disengaged from the
decomposition of the oxygen gas, and the union of its electricity with
that of the charcoal?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that less light and heat should be liberated in
this than in almost any other combustion,
<span class = "pagenum">294</span>
<a name = "page294" id = "page294"> </a>
since the oxygen, instead of entering into a solid or liquid
combination, as it does in the phosphoric and sulphuric acids, is
employed in forming another elastic fluid; it therefore parts with less
of its caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>True; and, on second consideration, it appears, on the contrary,
surprising that the oxygen should, in its combination with carbon,
retain a sufficient portion of caloric to maintain both substances in a
gaseous state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>We may then judge of the degree of solidity in which oxygen is
combined in a burnt body, by the quantity of caloric liberated during
its combustion?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; provided that you take into the account the quantity of oxygen
absorbed by the combustible body, and observe the proportion which the
caloric bears to&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But why should the water, after the combustion of carbon, rise in the
receiver, since the gas within it retains an aëriform state?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because the carbonic acid gas is gradually absorbed
<span class = "pagenum">295</span>
<a name = "page295" id = "page295"> </a>
by the water; and this effect would be promoted by shaking the
receiver.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The charcoal is now extinguished, though it is not nearly consumed;
it has such an extraordinary avidity for oxygen, I&nbsp;suppose, that
the receiver did not contain enough to satisfy the whole.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is certainly the case; for if the combustion were performed in
the exact proportions of 28 parts of carbon to 72 of oxygen, both these
ingredients would disappear, and 100 parts of carbonic acid would be
produced.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid must be a very strong acid, since it contains so great
a proportion of oxygen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is a very natural inference; yet it is erroneous. For the
carbonic is the weakest of all the acids. The strength of an acid seems
to depend upon the nature of its basis, and its mode of combination, as
well as upon the proportion of the acidifying principle. The same
quantity of oxygen that will convert some bodies into strong acids, will
only be sufficient simply to oxydate others.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">296</span>
<a name = "page296" id = "page296"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Since this acid is so weak, I think chemists should have called it
the <i>carbonous</i>, instead of the <i>carbonic</i> acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But, I suppose, the carbonous acid is still weaker, and is formed by
burning carbon in atmospherical air.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It has been lately discovered, that carbon may be converted into a
gas, by uniting with a smaller proportion of oxygen; but as this gas
does not possess any acid properties, it is no more than an oxyd; it is
called <i>gaseous oxyd of carbon</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Pray is not carbonic acid a very wholesome gas to breathe, as it
contains so much oxygen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it is extremely pernicious. Oxygen, when in a state
of combination with other substances, loses, in almost every instance,
its respirable properties, and the salubrious effects which it has on
the animal economy when in its unconfined state. Carbonic acid is not
only unfit for respiration, but extremely deleterious if taken into the
lungs.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">297</span>
<a name = "page297" id = "page297"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>You know, Caroline, how very unwholesome the fumes of burning
charcoal are reckoned.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes; but, to confess the truth, I did not consider that a charcoal
fire produced carbonic acid gas.&mdash;Can this gas be condensed into a
liquid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No: for, as I told you before, it is a permanent elastic fluid. But
water can absorb a certain quantity of this gas, and can even be
impregnated with it, in a very strong degree, by the assistance of
agitation and pressure, as I am going to show you. I&nbsp;shall decant
some carbonic acid gas into this bottle, which I fill first with water,
in order to exclude the atmospherical air; the gas is then introduced
through the water, which you see it displaces, for it will not mix with
it in any quantity, unless strongly agitated, or allowed to stand over
it for some time. The bottle is now about half full of carbonic acid
gas, and the other half is still occupied by the water. By corking the
bottle, and then violently shaking it, in this way, I&nbsp;can mix the
gas and water together.&mdash;Now will you taste&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>It has a distinct acid taste.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">298</span>
<a name = "page298" id = "page298"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Yes, it is sensibly sour, and appears full of little bubbles.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It possesses likewise all the other properties of acids, but, of
course, in a less degree than the pure carbonic acid gas, as it is so
much diluted by water.</p>

<p>This is a kind of artificial Seltzer water. By analysing that which
is produced by nature, it was found to contain scarcely any thing more
than common water impregnated with a certain proportion of carbonic acid
gas. We are, therefore, able to imitate it, by mixing those proportions
of water and carbonic acid. Here, my dear, is an instance, in which, by
a chemical process, we can exactly copy the operations of nature; for
the artificial Seltzer waters can be made in every respect similar to
those of nature; in one point, indeed, the former have an advantage,
since <ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘thay’">they</ins> may
be prepared stronger, or weaker, as occasion requires.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I thought I had tasted such water before. But what renders it so
brisk and sparkling?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This sparkling, or effervescence, as it is called, is always
occasioned by the action of an elastic fluid escaping from a liquid; in
the <ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘artifical’">artificial</ins> Seltzer
<span class = "pagenum">299</span>
<a name = "page299" id = "page299"> </a>
water, it is produced by the carbonic acid, which being lighter than the
water in which it was strongly condensed, flies off with great rapidity
the instant the bottle is uncorked; this makes it necessary to drink it
immediately. The bubbling that took place in this bottle was but
trifling, as the water was but very slightly impregnated with carbonic
acid. It requires a particular apparatus to prepare the gaseous
artificial mineral waters.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>If, then, a bottle of Seltzer water remains for any length of time
uncorked, I&nbsp;suppose it returns to the state of common water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The whole of the carbonic acid gas, or very nearly so, will soon
disappear; but there is likewise in Seltzer water a very small quantity
of soda, and of a few other saline or earthy ingredients, which will
remain in the water, though it should be kept uncorked for any length of
time.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I have often heard of people drinking soda-water. Pray what sort of
water is that?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is a kind of artificial Seltzer water, holding
<span class = "pagenum">300</span>
<a name = "page300" id = "page300"> </a>
in solution, besides the gaseous acid, a&nbsp;particular saline
substance, called soda, which imparts to the water certain medicinal
qualities.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But how can these waters be so wholesome, since carbonic acid is so
pernicious?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>A gas, we may conceive, though very prejudicial to breathe, may be
beneficial to the stomach.&mdash;But it would be of no use to attempt
explaining this more fully at present.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Are waters never impregnated with other gases?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; there are several kinds of gaseous waters. I&nbsp;forgot to tell
you that waters have, for some years past, been prepared, impregnated
both with oxygen and hydrogen gases. These are not an imitation of
nature, but are altogether obtained by artificial means. They have been
lately used medicinally, particularly on the continent, where,
I&nbsp;understand, they have acquired some reputation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>If I recollect right, Mrs. B., you told us that
<span class = "pagenum">301</span>
<a name = "page301" id = "page301"> </a>
carbon was capable of decomposing water; the affinity between oxygen and
carbon must, therefore, be greater than between oxygen and hydrogen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; but this is not the case unless their temperature be raised to a
certain degree. It is only when carbon is red-hot, that it is capable of
separating the oxygen from the hydrogen. Thus, if a small quantity of
water be thrown on a red-hot fire, it will increase rather than
extinguish the combustion; for the coals or wood (both of which contain
a quantity of carbon) decompose the water, and thus supply the fire both
with oxygen and hydrogen gases. If, on the contrary, a&nbsp;large mass
of water be thrown over the fire, the diminution of heat thus produced
is such, that the combustible matter loses the power of decomposing the
water, and the fire is extinguished.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I have heard that fire-engines sometimes do more harm than good, and
that they actually increase the fire when they cannot throw water enough
to extinguish it. It must be owing, no doubt, to the decomposition of
the water by the carbon during the conflagration.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">302</span>
<a name = "page302" id = "page302"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly.&mdash;The apparatus which you see here (<a class =
"smallcaps" href = "#plateXI">Plate XI.</a> fig.&nbsp;3.), may be used
to exemplify what we have just said. It consists in a kind of open
furnace, through which a porcelain tube, containing charcoal, passes. To
one end of the tube is adapted a glass retort with water in it; and the
other end communicates with a receiver placed on the water-bath.
A&nbsp;lamp being applied to the retort, and the water made to boil, the
vapour is gradually conveyed through the red-hot charcoal, by which it
is decomposed; and the hydrogen gas which results from this
decomposition is collected in the receiver. But the hydrogen thus
obtained is far from being pure; it retains in solution a minute portion
of carbon, and contains also a quantity of carbonic acid. This renders
it heavier than pure hydrogen gas, and gives it some peculiar
properties; it is distinguished by the name of <i>carbonated hydrogen
gas</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And whence does it obtain the carbonic acid that is mixed
with&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I believe I can answer that question, Caroline.&mdash;From the union
of the oxygen (proceeding from
<span class = "pagenum">303</span>
<a name = "page303" id = "page303"> </a>
the decomposed water) with the carbon, which, you know, makes carbonic
acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>True; I should have recollected that.&mdash;The product of the
decomposition of water by red-hot charcoal, therefore, is carbonated
hydrogen gas, and carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You are perfectly right now.</p>

<p>Carbon is frequently found combined with hydrogen in a state of
solidity, especially in coals, which owe their combustible nature to
these two principles.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is it the hydrogen, then, that produces the flame of coals?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is so; and when all the hydrogen is consumed, the carbon continues
to burn without flame. But again, as I mentioned when speaking of the
gas-lights, the hydrogen gas produced by the burning of coals is not
pure; for, during the combustion, particles of carbon are successively
volatilized with the hydrogen, with which they form what is called a
<i>hydro-carbonat</i>, which is the principal product of this
combustion.</p>

<p>Carbon is a very bad conductor of heat; for
<span class = "pagenum">304</span>
<a name = "page304" id = "page304"> </a>
this reason, it is employed (in conjunction with other ingredients) for
coating furnaces and other chemical apparatus.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray what is the use of coating furnaces?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>In most cases, in which a furnace is used, it is necessary to produce
and preserve a great degree of heat, for which purpose every possible
means are used to prevent the heat from escaping by communicating with
other bodies, and this object is attained by coating over the inside of
the furnace with a kind of plaster, composed of materials that are bad
conductors of heat.</p>

<p>Carbon, combined with a small quantity of iron, forms a compound
called plumbago, or black-lead, of which pencils are made. This
substance, agreeably to the nomenclature, is <i>a&nbsp;carburet of
iron</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Why, then, is it called black-lead?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is an ancient name given to it by ignorant people, from its
shining metallic appearance; but it is certainly a most improper name
for it, as there is not a particle of lead in the composition.
<span class = "pagenum">305</span>
<a name = "page305" id = "page305"> </a>
There is only one mine of this mineral, which is in Cumberland. It is
supposed to approach as nearly to pure carbon as the best prepared
charcoal does, as it contains only five parts of iron, unadulterated by
any other foreign ingredients. There is another carburet of iron, in
which the iron, though united only to an extremely small proportion of
carbon, acquires very remarkable properties; this is steel.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Really; and yet steel is much harder than iron?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But carbon is not ductile like iron, and therefore may render the
steel more brittle, and prevent its bending so easily. Whether it is
that the carbon, by introducing itself into the pores of the iron, and,
by filling them, makes the metal both harder and heavier; or whether
this change depends upon some chemical cause, I&nbsp;cannot pretend to
decide. But there is a subsequent operation, by which the hardness of
steel is very much increased, which simply consists in heating the steel
till it is red-hot, and then plunging it into cold water.</p>

<p>Carbon, besides the combination just mentioned, enters into the
composition of a vast number of natural productions, such, for instance,
as all
<span class = "pagenum">306</span>
<a name = "page306" id = "page306"> </a>
the various kinds of oils, which result from the combination of carbon,
hydrogen, and caloric, in various proportions.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I thought that carbon, hydrogen, and caloric, formed carbonated
hydrogen gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is the case when a small portion of carbonic acid gas is held in
solution by hydrogen gas. Different proportions of the same principles,
together with the circumstances of their union, produce very different
combinations; of this you will see innumerable examples. Besides, we are
not now talking of gases, but of carbon and hydrogen, combined only with
a quantity of caloric sufficient to bring them to the consistency of oil
or fat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But oil and fat are not of the same consistence?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Fat is only congealed oil; or oil, melted fat. The one requires a
little more heat to maintain it in a fluid state than the other. Have
you never observed the fat of meat turned to oil by the caloric it has
imbibed from the fire?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">307</span>
<a name = "page307" id = "page307"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yet oils in general, as salad-oil, and lamp-oil, do not turn to fat
when cold?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not at the common temperature of the atmosphere, because they retain
too much caloric to congeal at that temperature; but if exposed to a
sufficient degree of cold, their latent heat is extricated, and they
become solid fat substances. Have you never seen salad oil frozen in
winter?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes; but it appears to me in that state very different from animal
fat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The essential constituent parts of either vegetable or animal oils
are the same, carbon and hydrogen; their variety arises from the
different proportions of these substances, and from other accessory
ingredients that may be mixed with them. The oil of a whale, and the oil
of roses, are, in their essential constituent parts, the same; but the
one is impregnated with the offensive particles of animal matter, the
other with the delicate perfume of a flower.</p>

<p>The difference of <i>fixed oils</i>, and <i>volatile</i> or
<i>essential oils</i>, consists also in the various proportions of
carbon and hydrogen. Fixed oils are those which
<span class = "pagenum">308</span>
<a name = "page308" id = "page308"> </a>
will not evaporate without being decomposed; this is the case with all
common oils, which contain a greater proportion of carbon than the
essential oils. The essential oils (which comprehend the whole class of
essences and perfumes) are lighter; they contain more equal proportions
of carbon and hydrogen, and are volatilized or evaporated without being
decomposed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>When you say that one kind of oil will evaporate, and the other be
decomposed, you mean, I&nbsp;suppose, by the application of heat?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not necessarily; for there are oils that will evaporate slowly at the
common temperature of the atmosphere; but for a more rapid
volatilization, or for their decomposition, the assistance of heat is
required.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I shall now remember, I think, that fat and oil are really the same
substances, both consisting of carbon and hydrogen; that in fixed oils
the carbon preponderates, and heat produces a decomposition; while, in
essential oils, the proportion of hydrogen is greater, and heat produces
a volatilization only.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I suppose the reason why oil burns so well in
<span class = "pagenum">309</span>
<a name = "page309" id = "page309"> </a>
lamps is because its two constituents are so combustible?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly; the combustion of oil is just the same as that of a
candle; if tallow, it is only oil in a concrete state; if wax, or

carbon.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I wonder, then, there should be so great a difference between tallow
and wax?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I must again repeat, that the same substances, in different
proportions, produce results that have sometimes scarcely any
resemblance to each other. But this is rather a general remark that I
wish to impress upon your minds, than one which is applicable to the
present case; for tallow and wax are far from being very dissimilar; the
chief difference consists in the wax being a purer compound of carbon
and hydrogen than the tallow, which retains more of the gross particles
of animal matter. The combustion of a candle, and that of a lamp, both
produce water and carbonic acid gas. Can you tell me how these are
formed?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Let me reflect . . . . Both the candle and lamp
<span class = "pagenum">310</span>
<a name = "page310" id = "page310"> </a>
burn by means of fixed oil&mdash;this is decomposed as the combustion
goes on; and the constituent parts of the oil being thus separated, the
carbon unites to a portion of oxygen from the atmosphere to form
carbonic acid gas, whilst the hydrogen combines with another portion of
oxygen, and forms with it water.&mdash;The products, therefore, of the
combustion of oils are water and carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But we see neither water nor carbonic acid produced by the combustion
of a candle.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The carbonic acid gas, you know, is invisible, and the water being in
a state of vapour, is so likewise. Emily is perfectly correct in her
explanation, and I am very much pleased with&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>All the vegetable acids consist of various proportions of carbon and
hydrogen, acidified by oxygen. Gums, sugar, and starch, are likewise
composed of these ingredients; but, as the oxygen which they contain is
not sufficient to convert them into acids, they are classed with the
oxyds, and called vegetable oxyds.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I am very much delighted with all these new
<span class = "pagenum">311</span>
<a name = "page311" id = "page311"> </a>
ideas; but, at the same time, I&nbsp;cannot help being apprehensive that
I may forget many of them.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I would advise you to take notes, or, what would answer better still,
to write down, after every lesson, as much of it as you can recollect.
And, in order to give you a little assistance, I&nbsp;shall lend you the
heads or index, which I occasionally consult for the sake of preserving
some method and arrangement in these conversations. Unless you follow
some such plan, you cannot expect to retain nearly all that you learn,
how great soever be the impression it may make on you at first.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I will certainly follow your advice.&mdash;Hitherto I have found that
I recollected pretty well what you have taught us; but the history of
carbon is a more extensive subject than any of the simple bodies we have
yet examined.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I have little more to say on carbon at present; but hereafter you
will see that it performs a considerable part in most chemical
operations.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>That is, I suppose, owing to its entering into
<span class = "pagenum">312</span>
<a name = "page312" id = "page312"> </a>
the composition of so great a variety of substances?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly; it is the basis, you have seen, of all vegetable matter;
and you will find that it is very essential to the process of
animalization. But in the mineral kingdom also, particularly in its form
of carbonic acid, we shall often discover it combined with a great
variety of substances.</p>

<p>In chemical operations, carbon is particularly useful, from its very
great attraction for oxygen, as it will absorb this substance from many
oxygenated or burnt bodies, and thus deoxygenate, or <i>unburn</i> them,
and restore them to their original combustible state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I do not understand how a body can be <i>unburnt</i>, and restored to
its original state. This piece of tinder, for instance, that has been
burnt, if by any means the oxygen were extracted from it, would not be
restored to its former state of linen; for its texture is destroyed by
burning, and that must be the case with all organized or manufactured
substances, as you observed in a former conversation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>A compound body is decomposed by combustion in a way which generally
precludes the possibility
<span class = "pagenum">313</span>
<a name = "page313" id = "page313"> </a>
of restoring it to its former state; the oxygen, for instance, does not
become fixed in the tinder, but it combines with its volatile parts, and
flies off in the shape of gas, or watery vapour. You see, therefore, how
vain it would be to attempt the recomposition of such bodies. But, with
regard to simple bodies, or at least bodies whose component parts are
not disturbed by the process of oxygenation or deoxygenation, it is
often possible to restore them, after combustion, to their original
state.&mdash;The metals, for instance, undergo no other alteration by
combustion than a combination with oxygen; therefore, when the oxygen is
taken from them, they return to their pure metallic state. But I shall
say nothing further of this at present, as the metals will furnish ample
subject for another morning; and they are the class of simple bodies
that come next under consideration.</p>

very different nature from those which we have hitherto considered. They
do not, like the bases of gases, elude the immediate observation of our
senses; for they are the most brilliant, the most ponderous, and the
most palpable substances in nature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I doubt, however, whether the metals will appear to us so
interesting, and give us so much entertainment as those mysterious
elements which conceal themselves from our view. Besides, they cannot
afford so much novelty; they are bodies with which we are already so
well acquainted.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You are not aware, my dear, of the interesting discoveries which were
a few years ago made by Sir H. Davy respecting this class of bodies. By
the aid of the Voltaic battery, he has obtained from
<span class = "pagenum">315</span>
<a name = "page315" id = "page315"> </a>
a&nbsp;variety of substances, metals before unknown, the properties of
which are equally new and curious. We shall begin, however, by noticing
those metals with which you profess to be so well acquainted. But the
acquaintance, you will soon perceive, is but very superficial; and I
trust that you will find both novelty and entertainment in considering
the metals in a chemical point of view. To treat of this subject fully,
would require a whole course of lectures; for metals form of themselves
a most important branch of practical chemistry. We must, therefore,
confine ourselves to a general view of them. These bodies are seldom
found naturally in their metallic form: they are generally more or less
oxygenated or combined with sulphur, earths, or acids, and are often
blended with each other. They are found buried in the bowels of the
earth in most parts of the world, but chiefly in mountainous districts,
where the surface of the globe has suffered from the earthquakes,
volcanos, and other convulsions of nature. They are spread in strata or
beds, called veins, and these veins are composed of a certain quantity
of metal, combined with various earthy substances, with which they form
minerals of different nature and appearance, which are called
<i>ores</i>.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I now feel quite at home, for my father has
<span class = "pagenum">316</span>
<a name = "page316" id = "page316"> </a>
a&nbsp;lead-mine in Yorkshire, and I have heard a great deal about veins
of ore, and of the <i>roasting</i> and <i>smelting</i> of the lead; but,
I&nbsp;confess, that I do not understand in what these operations
consist.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Roasting is the process by which the volatile parts of the ore are
evaporated; smelting, that by which the pure metal is afterwards
separated from the earthy remains of the ore. This is done by throwing
the whole into a furnace, and mixing with it certain substances that
will combine with the earthy parts and other foreign ingredients of the
ore; the metal being the heaviest, falls to the bottom, and runs out by
proper openings in its pure metallic state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>You told us in a preceding lesson that metals had a great affinity
for oxygen. Do they not, therefore, combine with oxygen, when strongly
heated in the furnace, and run out in the state of oxyds?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; for the scoriæ, or oxyd, which soon forms on the surface of the
fused metal, when it is oxydable, prevents the air from having any
further influence on the mass; so that neither combustion nor
oxygenation can take place.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">317</span>
<a name = "page317" id = "page317"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Are all the metals equally combustible?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; their attraction for oxygen varies extremely. There are some that
will combine with it only at a very high temperature, or by the
assistance of acids; whilst there are others that oxydate spontaneously
and with great rapidity, even at the lowest temperature; such is in
particular manganese, which scarcely ever exists in the metallic state,
as it immediately absorbs oxygen on being exposed to the air, and
crumbles to an oxyd in the course of a few hours.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is not that the oxyd from which you extracted the oxygen gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is: so that, you see, this metal attracts oxygen at a low
temperature, and parts with it when strongly heated.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is there any other metal that oxydates at the temperature of the
atmosphere?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They all do, more or less, excepting gold, silver, and platina.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">318</span>
<a name = "page318" id = "page318"> </a>
<p>Copper, lead, and iron, oxydate slowly in the air, and cover
themselves with a sort of rust, a&nbsp;process which depends on the
gradual conversion of the surface into an oxyd. This rusty surface
preserves the interior metal from oxydation, as it prevents the air from
coming in contact with it. Strictly speaking, however, the word rust
applies only to the oxyd, which forms on the surface of iron, when
exposed to air and moisture, which oxyd appears to be united with a
small portion of carbonic acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>When metals oxydate from the atmosphere without an elevation of
temperature, some light and heat, I&nbsp;suppose, must be disengaged,
though not in sufficient quantities to be sensible.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly; and, indeed, it is not surprising that in this case the
light and heat should not be sensible, when you consider how extremely
slow, and, indeed, how imperfectly, most metals oxydate by mere exposure
to the atmosphere. For the quantity of oxygen with which metals are
capable of combining, generally depends upon their temperature; and the
absorption stops at various points of oxydation, according to the degree
to which their temperature is raised.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">319</span>
<a name = "page319" id = "page319"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That seems very natural; for the greater the quantity of caloric
introduced into a metal, the more will its positive electricity be
exalted, and consequently the stronger will be its affinity for
oxygen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly. When the metal oxygenates with sufficient rapidity for
light and heat to become sensible, combustion actually takes place. But
this happens only at very high temperatures, and the product is
nevertheless an oxyd; for though, as I have just said, metals will
combine with different proportions of oxygen, yet with the exception of
only five of them, they are not susceptible of acidification.</p>

<p>Metals change colour during the different degrees of oxydation which
they undergo. Lead, when heated in contact with the atmosphere, first
becomes grey; if its temperature be then raised, it turns yellow, and a
still stronger heat changes it to red. Iron becomes successively a
green, brown, and white oxyd. Copper changes from brown to blue, and
lastly green.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray, is the white lead with which houses are painted prepared by
oxydating lead?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">320</span>
<a name = "page320" id = "page320"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not merely by oxydating, but by being also united with carbonic acid.
It is a carbonat of lead. The mere oxyd of lead is called red lead.
Litharge is another oxyd of lead, containing less oxygen. Almost all the
metallic oxyds are used as paints. The various sorts of ochres consist
chiefly of iron more or less oxydated. And it is a remarkable
circumstance, that if you burn metals rapidly, the light or flame they
emit during combustion partakes of the colours which the oxyd
successively assumes.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>How is that accounted for, Mrs. B.? For light, you know, does not
proceed from the burning body, but from the decomposition of the oxygen
gas?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The correspondence of the colour of the light with that of the oxyd
which emits it, is, in all probability, owing to some particles of the
metal which are volatilised and carried off by the caloric.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is then a sort of metallic gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Why is it reckoned so unwholesome to breathe the air of a place in
which metals are melting?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">321</span>
<a name = "page321" id = "page321"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Perhaps the notion is too generally entertained. But it is true with
respect to lead, and some other noxious metals, because, unless care be
taken, the particles of the oxyd which are volatilised by the heat are
inhaled in with the breath, and may produce dangerous effects.</p>

<p>I must show you some instances of the combustion of metals; it would
require the heat of a furnace to make them burn in the common air, but
if we supply them with a stream of oxygen gas, we may easily
accomplish&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But it will still, I suppose, be necessary in some degree to raise
their temperature?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This, as you shall see, is very easily done, particularly if the
experiment be tried upon a small scale.&mdash;I&nbsp;begin by lighting
this piece of charcoal with the candle, and then increase the rapidity

<p>That I do not understand; for it is not every kind of air, but merely
oxygen gas, that produces combustion. Now you said that in breathing we
<span class = "pagenum">322</span>
<a name = "page322" id = "page322"> </a>
inspired, but did not expire oxygen gas. Why, therefore, should the air
which you breathe through the blow-pipe promote the combustion of the
charcoal?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because the air, which has but once passed through the lungs, is yet
but little altered, a&nbsp;small portion only of its oxygen being
destroyed; so that a great deal more is gained by increasing the
rapidity of the current, by means of the blow-pipe, than is lost in
consequence of the air passing once through the lungs, as you shall
see&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, it makes the charcoal burn much brighter.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Whilst it is red-hot, I shall drop some iron filings on it, and
supply them with a current of oxygen gas, by means of this apparatus,
(<a class = "smallcaps" href = "#plateXII">Plate XII.</a> fig 2.) which
consists simply of a closed tin cylindrical vessel, full of oxygen gas,
with two apertures and stop-cocks, by one of which a stream of water is
thrown into the vessel through a long funnel, whilst by the other the
gas is forced out through a blow-pipe adapted to it, as the water gains
admittance.&mdash;Now that I pour water into the funnel, you may hear
the gas issuing from the
<span class = "pagenum">323</span>
<a name = "page323" id = "page323"> </a>
blow-pipe&mdash;I bring the charcoal close to the current, and drop the
filings upon&nbsp;it&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>They emit much the same vivid light as the combustion of the iron
wire in oxygen gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The process is, in fact, the same; there is only some difference in
the mode of conducting it. Let us burn some tin in the same
manner&mdash;you see that it is equally combustible.&mdash;Let us now
try some copper&mdash;</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>This burns with a greenish flame; it is, I&nbsp;suppose, owing to the
colour of the oxyd?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Pray, shall we not also burn some gold?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is not in our power, at least in this way. Gold, silver, and
platina, are incapable of being oxydated by the greatest heat that we
can produce by the common method. It is from this circumstance, that
they have been called perfect metals. Even these, however, have an
affinity for oxygen; but their oxydation or combustion can be performed
only by means of acids or by electricity.
<span class = "pagenum">324</span>
<a name = "page324" id = "page324"> </a>
The spark given out by the Voltaic battery produces at the point of
contact a greater degree of heat than any other process; and it is at
this very high temperature only that the affinity of these metals for
oxygen will enable them to act on each other.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I cannot show you the combustion of the perfect
metals by this process, but it requires a considerable Voltaic battery.
You will see these experiments performed in the most perfect manner,
when you attend the chemical lectures of the Royal Institution. But in
the mean time I can, without difficulty, show you an ingenious apparatus
lately contrived for the purpose of producing intense heats, the power
of which nearly equals that of the largest Voltaic batteries. It simply
consists, you see, in a strong box, made of iron or copper, (<a class =
"smallcaps" href = "#plateXb">Plate X.</a> fig.&nbsp;2.) to which may be
adapted this air-syringe or condensing-pump, and a stop-cock terminating
in a small orifice similar to that of a blow-pipe. By working the
condensing syringe, up and down in this manner, a&nbsp;quantity of air
is accumulated in the vessel, which may be increased to almost any
extent; so that if we now turn the stop-cock, the condensed air will
rush out, forming a jet of considerable force; and if we place the flame
of a lamp in the current, you will see how violently the flame is driven
in that direction.</p>

<p>It seems to be exactly the same effect as that of a blow-pipe worked

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Yes; and this new instrument has this additional advantage, that it
does not fatigue the mouth and lungs like the common blow-pipe, and
requires no art in blowing.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Unquestionably; but yet this blow-pipe would be of very limited
utility, if its energy and power could not be greatly increased by some
other contrivance. Can you imagine any mode of producing such an
effect?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Could not the reservoir be charged with pure oxygen, instead of
common air, as in the case of the gas-holder?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly; and this is precisely the contrivance I allude to. The
vessel need only be supplied with air from a bladder full of oxygen,
instead of the air of the room, and this, you see, may be easily done by
screwing the bladder on the upper part of the syringe, so that in
working the syringe the oxygen gas is forced from the bladder into the
condensing vessel.</p>

<p>With the aid of this small apparatus, therefore, we could obtain the
same effects as those we have just produced with the gas-holder, by
means of a column of water forcing the gas out of&nbsp;it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; and much more conveniently so. But there is a mode of using this
apparatus by which more powerful effects still may be obtained. It
consists in condensing in the reservoir, not oxygen alone, but a mixture
of oxygen and hydrogen in the exact proportion in which they unite to
produce water; and then kindling the jet formed by the mixed gases. The
heat disengaged by this combustion, without the help of any lamp, is
probably the most intense known; and various effects are said to have
been obtained from it which exceed all expectation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But why should we not try this experiment?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because it is not exempt from danger; the combustion (notwithstanding
various contrivances which have been resorted to with a view to prevent
accident) being apt to penetrate into the inside of the vessel, and to
produce a dangerous and violent
<span class = "pagenum">327</span>

explosion.&mdash;We shall, therefore, now proceed in our subject.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I think you said the oxyds of metals could be restored to their
metallic state?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; this is called <i>reviving</i> a metal. Metals are in general
capable of being revived by charcoal, when heated red hot, charcoal
having a greater attraction for oxygen than the metals. You need only,
therefore, decompose, or unburn the oxyd, by depriving it of its oxygen,
and the metal will be restored to its pure state.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But will the carbon, by this operation, be burnt, and be converted
into carbonic acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly. There are other combustible substances to which metals at
a high temperature will part with their oxygen. They will also yield it
to each other, according to their several degrees of attraction for it;
and if the oxygen goes into a more dense state in the metal which it
enters, than it existed in that which it quits, a&nbsp;proportional
disengagement of caloric will take place.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">328</span>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And cannot the oxyds of gold, silver, and platina, which are formed
by means of acids or of the electric fluid, be restored to their
metallic state?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, they may; and the intervention of a combustible body is not
required; heat alone will take the oxygen from them, convert it into a
gas, and revive the metal.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>You said that rust was an oxyd of iron; how is it, then, that water,
or merely dampness, produces it, which, you know, it very frequently
does on steel grates, or any iron instruments?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>In that case the metal decomposes the water, or dampness (which is
nothing but water in a state of vapour), and obtains the oxygen
from&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I thought that it was necessary to bring metals to a very high
temperature to enable them to decompose water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is so, if it is required that the process should be performed
rapidly, and if any considerable quantity is to be decomposed. Rust, you
knew,
<span class = "pagenum">329</span>
<a name = "page329" id = "page329"> </a>
is sometimes months in forming, and then it is only the surface of the
metal that is oxydated.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Metals, then, that do not rust, are incapable of spontaneous
oxydation, either by air or water?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; and this is the case with the perfect metals, which, on that
account, preserve their metallic lustre so well.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Are all metals capable of decomposing water, provided their
temperature be sufficiently raised?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>No; a certain degree of attraction is requisite, besides the
assistance of heat. Water, you recollect, is composed of oxygen and
hydrogen; and, unless the affinity of the metal for oxygen be stronger
than that of hydrogen, it is in vain that we raise its temperature, for
it cannot take the oxygen from the hydrogen. Iron, zinc, tin, and
antimony, have a stronger affinity for oxygen than hydrogen has,
therefore these four metals are capable of decomposing water. But
hydrogen having an advantage over all the other metals with respect to
its affinity for oxygen, it not only withholds its oxygen from them, but
is even capable,
<span class = "pagenum">330</span>
<a name = "page330" id = "page330"> </a>
under certain circumstances, of taking the oxygen from the oxyds of
these metals.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I confess that I do not quite understand why hydrogen can take oxygen
from those metals that do not decompose water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Now I think I do perfectly. Lead, for instance, will not decompose
water, because it has not so strong an attraction for oxygen as hydrogen
has. Well, then, suppose the lead to be in a state of oxyd; hydrogen
will take the oxygen from the lead, and unite with it to form water,
because hydrogen has a stronger attraction for oxygen, than oxygen has
for lead; and it is the same with all the other metals which do not
decompose water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I understand your explanation, Caroline, very well; and I imagine
that it is because lead cannot decompose water that it is so much
employed for pipes for conveying that fluid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly; lead is, on that account, particularly appropriate to such
purposes; whilst, on the contrary, this metal, if it was oxydable by
water,
<span class = "pagenum">331</span>
<a name = "page331" id = "page331"> </a>
would impart to it very noxious qualities, as all oxyds of lead are more
or less pernicious.</p>

<p>But, with regard to the oxydation of metals, the most powerful mode
of effecting it is by means of acids. These, you know, contain a much
greater proportion of oxygen than either air or water; and will, most of
them, easily yield it to metals. Thus, you recollect, the zinc plates of
the Voltaic battery are oxydated by the acid and water, much more
effectually than by water alone.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And I have often observed that if I drop vinegar, lemon, or any acid
on the blade of a knife, or on a pair of <ins class = "correction" title
= "unchanged">scissars</ins>, it will immediately produce a spot of
rust.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Metals have, then, three ways of obtaining oxygen; from the
atmosphere, from water, and from acids.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The two first you have already witnessed, and I shall now show you
how metals take the oxygen from an acid. This bottle contains nitric
acid; I&nbsp;shall pour some of it over this piece of copper-leaf
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Oh, what a disagreeable smell!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">332</span>
<a name = "page332" id = "page332"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And what is it that produces the effervescency and that thick yellow
vapour?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is the acid, which being abandoned by the greatest part of its
oxygen, is converted into a weaker acid, which escapes in the form of
gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And whence proceeds this heat?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Indeed, Caroline, I think you might now be able to answer that
question yourself.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is that the oxygen enters into the metal in a more solid
state than it existed in the acid, in consequence of which caloric is
disengaged.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>If the combination of the oxygen and the metal results from the union
of their opposite electricities, of course caloric must be given
out.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The effervescence is over; therefore I suppose that the metal is now
oxydated.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">333</span>
<a name = "page333" id = "page333"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes. But there is another important connection between metals and
acids, with which I must now make you acquainted. Metals, when in the
state of oxyds, are capable of being dissolved by acids. In this
operation they enter into a chemical combination with the acid, and form
an entirely new compound.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But what difference is there between the <i>oxydation</i> and the
<i>dissolution</i> of the metal by an acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>In the first case, the metal merely combines with a portion of oxygen
taken from the acid, which is thus partly deoxygenated, as in the
instance you have just seen; in the second case, the metal, after being
previously oxydated, is actually dissolved in the acid, and enters into
a chemical combination with it, without producing any further
decomposition or effervescence.&mdash;This complete combination of an
oxyd and an acid forms a peculiar and important class of compound
salts.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>The difference between an oxyd and a compound salt, therefore, is
very obvious: the one consists of a metal and oxygen; the other of an
oxyd and an acid.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">334</span>
<a name = "page334" id = "page334"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well: and you will be careful to remember that the metals are
incapable of entering into this combination with acids, unless they are
previously oxydated; therefore, whenever you bring a metal in contact
with an acid, it will be first oxydated and afterwards dissolved,
provided that there be a sufficient quantity of acid for both
operations.</p>

<p>There are some metals, however, whose solution is more easily
accomplished, by diluting the acid in water; and the metal will, in this
case, be oxydated, not by the acid, but by the water, which it will
decompose. But in proportion as the oxygen of the water oxydates the
surface of the metal, the acid combines with it, washes it off, and
leaves a fresh surface for the oxygen to act upon: then other coats of
oxyd are successively formed, and rapidly dissolved by the acid, which
continues combining with the new-formed surfaces of oxyd till the whole
of the metal is dissolved. During this process the hydrogen gas of the
water is disengaged, and flies off with effervescence.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Was not this the manner in which the sulphuric acid assisted the iron
filings in decomposing water?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">335</span>
<a name = "page335" id = "page335"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Exactly; and it is thus that several metals, which are incapable
alone of decomposing water, are enabled to do it by the assistance of an
acid, which, by continually washing off the covering of oxyd, as it is
formed, prepares a fresh surface of metal to act upon the water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>The acid here seems to act a part not very different from that of a
scrubbing-brush.&mdash;But pray would not this be a good method of
cleaning metallic utensils?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; on some occasions a weak acid, as vinegar, is used for cleaning
copper. Iron plates, too, are freed from the rust on their surface by
diluted muriatic acid, previous to their being covered with tin. You
must remember, however, that in this mode of cleaning metals the acid
should be quickly afterwards wiped off, otherwise it would produce fresh
oxyd.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Let us watch the dissolution of the copper in the nitric acid; for I
am very impatient to see the salt that is to result from it. The mixture
is now of a beautiful blue colour; but there is no appearance
<span class = "pagenum">336</span>
<a name = "page336" id = "page336"> </a>
of the formation of a salt; it seems to be a tedious operation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The crystallisation of the salt requires some length of time to be
completed; if, however, you are so impatient, I&nbsp;can easily show you
a metallic salt already formed.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But that would not satisfy my curiosity half so well as one of our
own manufacturing.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is one of our own preparing that I mean to show you. When we
decomposed water a few days since, by the oxydation of iron filings
through the assistance of sulphuric acid, in what did the process
consist?</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>In proportion as the water yielded its oxygen to the iron, the acid
combined with the new-formed oxyd, and the hydrogen escaped alone.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well; the result, therefore, was a compound salt, formed by the
combination of sulphuric acid with oxyd of iron. It still remains in
<span class = "pagenum">337</span>
<a name = "page337" id = "page337"> </a>
the vessel in which the experiment was performed. Fetch it, and we shall
examine&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What a variety of processes the decomposition of water, by a metal
and an acid, implies; 1st, the decomposition of the water; 2dly, the
oxydation of the metal; and 3dly, the formation of a compound salt.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Here it is, Mrs. B.&mdash;What beautiful green crystals! But we do
not perceive any crystals in the solution of copper in nitrous acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because the salt is now suspended in the water which the nitrous acid
contains, and will remain so till it is deposited in consequence of rest
and cooling.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I am surprised that a body so opake as iron can be converted into
such transparent crystals.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is the union with the acid that produces the transparency; for if
the pure metal were melted, and afterwards permitted to cool and
crystallise, it would be found just as opake as before.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">338</span>
<a name = "page338" id = "page338"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I do not understand the exact meaning of <i>crystallisation</i>?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You recollect that when a solid body is dissolved either by water or
caloric it is not decomposed; but that its integrant parts are only
suspended in the solvent. When the solution is made in water, the
integrant particles of the body will, on the water being evaporated,
again unite into a solid mass by the force of their mutual attraction.
But when the body is dissolved by caloric alone, nothing more is
necessary, in order to make its particles reunite, than to reduce its
temperature. And, in general, if the solvent, whether water or caloric,
be slowly separated by evaporation or by cooling, and care taken that
the particles be not agitated during their reunion, they will arrange
themselves in regular masses, each individual substance assuming a
peculiar form or arrangement; and this is what is called
crystallisation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Crystallisation, therefore, is simply the reunion of the particles of
a solid body that has been dissolved in a fluid.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">339</span>
<a name = "page339" id = "page339"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is a very good definition of it. But I must not forget to
observe, that <i>heat</i> and <i>water</i> may unite their solvent
powers; and, in this case, crystallisation may be hastened by cooling,
as well as by evaporating the liquid<ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ?">. </ins></p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But if the body dissolved is of a volatile nature, will it not
evaporate with the fluid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>A crystallised body held in solution only by water is scarcely ever
so volatile as the fluid itself, and care must be taken to manage the
heat so that it may be sufficient to evaporate the water only.</p>

<p>I should not omit also to mention that bodies, in crystallising from
their watery solution, always retain a small portion of water, which
remains confined in the crystal in a solid form, and does not reappear
unless the body loses its crystalline state. This is called the <i>water
of crystallisation</i>. But you must observe, that whilst a body may be
separated from its solution in water or caloric simply by cooling or by
evaporation, an acid can be taken from a metal with which it is combined
only by stronger affinities, which produce a decomposition.</p>

<p>Are the perfect metals susceptible of being dissolved and converted
into compound salts by acids?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Gold is acted upon by only one acid, the <i>oxygenated muriatic</i>,
a&nbsp;very remarkable acid, which, when in its most concentrated state,
dissolves gold or any other metal, by burning them rapidly.</p>

<p>Gold can, it is true, be dissolved likewise by a mixture of two
acids, commonly called <i>aqua regia</i>; but this mixed solvent derives
that property from containing the peculiar acid which I have just
mentioned. Platina is also acted upon by this acid only; silver is
dissolved by nitric acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I think you said that some of the metals might be so strongly
oxydated as to become acid?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>There are five metals, arsenic, molybdena, chrome, tungsten, and
columbium, which are susceptible of combining with a sufficient quantity
of oxygen to be converted into acids.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Acids are connected with metals in such a variety of ways, that I am
afraid of some confusion in remembering
<span class = "pagenum">341</span>
<a name = "page341" id = "page341"> </a>
them.&mdash;In the first place, acids will yield their oxygen to metals.
Secondly, they will combine with them in their state of oxyds, to form
compound salts; and lastly, several of the metals are themselves
susceptible of acidification.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Very well; but though metals have so great an affinity for acids, it
is not with that class of bodies alone that they will combine. They are
most of them, in their simple state, capable of uniting with sulphur,
with phosphorus, with carbon, and with each other; these combinations,
according to the nomenclature which was explained to you on a former
occasion, are called <i>sulphurets</i>, <i>phosphorets</i>,
<i>carburets</i>,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p>The metallic phosphorets offer nothing very remarkable. The
sulphurets form the peculiar kind of mineral called <i>pyrites</i>, from
which certain kinds of mineral waters, as those of Harrogate, derive
their chief chemical properties. In this combination, the sulphur,
together with the iron, have so strong an attraction for oxygen, that
they obtain it both from the air and from water, and by condensing it in
a solid form, produce the heat which raises the temperature of the water
in such a remarkable degree.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But if pyrites obtain oxygen from water, that
<span class = "pagenum">342</span>
<a name = "page342" id = "page342"> </a>
water must suffer a decomposition, and hydrogen gas be evolved.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That is actually the case in the hot springs alluded to, which give
out an extremely fetid gas, composed of hydrogen impregnated with
sulphur.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>If I recollect right, steel and plumbago, which you mentioned in the
last lesson, are both carburets of iron?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; and they are the only carburets of much consequence.</p>

<p>A curious combination of metals has lately very much attracted the
attention of the scientific world: I&nbsp;mean the meteoric stones that
fall from the atmosphere. They consist principally of native or pure
iron, which is never found in that state in the bowels of the earth; and
contain also a small quantity of nickel and chrome, a&nbsp;combination
likewise new in the mineral kingdom.</p>

<p>These circumstances have led many scientific persons to believe that
those substances have fallen from the moon, or some other planet, while
others are of opinion either that they are formed in the atmosphere, or
are projected into it by some unknown volcano on the surface of our
globe.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">343</span>
<a name = "page343" id = "page343"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I have heard much of these stones, but I believe many people are of
opinion that they are formed on the surface of the earth, and laugh at
their pretended celestial origin.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The fact of their falling is so well ascertained, that I think no
person who has at all investigated the subject, can now entertain any
doubt of it. Specimens of these stones have been discovered in all parts
of the world, and to each of them some tradition or story of its fall
has been found connected. And as the analysis of all those specimens
affords precisely the same results, there is strong reason to conjecture
that they all proceed from the same source. It is to Mr. Howard that
philosophers are indebted for having first analysed these stones, and
directed their attention to this interesting subject.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But pray, Mrs. B., how can solid masses of iron and nickel be formed
from the atmosphere, which consists of the two airs, nitrogen and
oxygen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I really do not see how they could, and think it much more probable
that they fall from the moon.&mdash;But we must not suffer this

<p>The combinations of metals with each other are called alloys; thus
brass is an alloy of copper and zinc; bronze, of copper and
tin,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>And is not pewter also a combination of metal?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is. The pewter made in this country is mostly composed of tin,

<p>Block-tin is a kind of pewter, I believe?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Properly speaking, block-tin means tin in blocks, or square massive
ingots; but in the sense in which it is used by ignorant workmen, it is
iron plated with tin, which renders it more durable, as tin will not so
easily rust. Tin alone, however, would be too soft a metal to be worked
for common use, and all tin-vessels and utensils are in fact made of
plates of iron, thinly coated with tin, which prevents the iron from
rusting.</p>

<p>Metals differ very much in their affinity for each other; some will
not unite at all, others readily combine together, and on this property
of metals the art of <i>soldering</i> depends.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What is soldering?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is joining two pieces of metal together, by a more fusible metal

silver, are solder for iron,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And is not <i>plating</i> metals something of the same nature?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

with the other, but without the intervention of a third; iron or copper

metals.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>One of its greatest peculiarities is, that it retains a fluid state
at the temperature of the atmosphere. All metals are fusible at
different degrees of heat, and they have likewise each the property of
freezing or becoming solid at a certain fixed temperature. Mercury
congeals only at seventy-two degrees below the freezing point.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>That is to say, that in order to freeze, it requires a temperature of
seventy-two degrees colder than that at which water freezes.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Exactly so.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But is the temperature of the atmosphere ever so low as that?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes, often in Siberia; but happily never in this part of the globe.
Here, however, mercury may be congealed by artificial cold; I&nbsp;mean
such intense cold as can be produced by some chemical
<span class = "pagenum">347</span>

<p>Yes, like any other liquid; only it requires a much greater degree of
heat. At the temperature of six hundred degrees, it begins to boil and
evaporate like water.</p>

<p>Mercury combines with gold, silver, tin, and with several other
metals; and, if mixed with any of them in a sufficient proportion, it
penetrates the solid metal, softens it, loses its own fluidity, and
forms an <i>amalgam</i>, which is the name given to the combination of
any metal with mercury, forming a substance more or less solid,
according as the mercury or the other metal predominates.</p>

have been recently discovered,
<span class = "pagenum">348</span>
<a name = "page348" id = "page348"> </a>
whose properties are yet but little known, as for instance, titanium,
which was discovered by the Rev. Mr. Gregor, in the tin-mines of
Cornwall; columbium or tantalium, which has lately been discovered by
Mr. Hatchett; and osmium, iridium, palladium, and rhodium, all of which
Dr. Wollaston and Mr. Tennant found mixed in minute quantities with
crude platina, and the distinct existence of which they proved by
curious and delicate experiments.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Arsenic has been mentioned amongst the metals<ins class = "mycorr"
title = "text has ,">. </ins>I&nbsp;had no notion that it belonged to
that class of bodies, for I had never seen it but as a powder, and never
thought of it but as a most deadly poison.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>In its pure metallic state, I believe, it is not so poisonous; but it
has such a great affinity for oxygen, that it absorbs it from the
atmosphere at its natural temperature: you have seen it, therefore, only
in its state of oxyd, when, from its combination with oxygen, it has
acquired its very poisonous properties.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Is it possible that oxygen can impart poisonous qualities? That
valuable substance which produces

light and fire, and which all bodies in nature are so eager to
obtain?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Most of the metallic oxyds are poisonous, and derive this property
from their union with oxygen. The white lead, so much used in paint,
owes its pernicious effects to oxygen. In general, oxygen, in a concrete
state, appears to be particularly destructive in its effects on flesh or
any animal matter; and those oxyds are most caustic that have an acrid
burning taste, which proceeds from the metal having but a slight
affinity for oxygen, and therefore easily yielding it to the flesh,
which it corrodes and destroys.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of the word <i>caustic</i>, which you have just
used?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It expresses that property which some bodies possess, of
disorganizing and destroying animal matter, by operating a kind of
combustion, or at least a chemical decomposition. You must often have
heard of caustic used to burn warts, or other animal excrescences; most
of these bodies owe their destructive power to the oxygen with which
they are combined. The common caustic, called
<span class = "pagenum">350</span>
<a name = "page350" id = "page350"> </a>
<i>lunar caustic</i>, is a compound formed by the union of nitric acid
and silver; and it is supposed to owe its caustic qualities to the
oxygen contained in the nitric acid.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But, pray, are not acids still more caustic than oxyds, as they
contain a greater proportion of oxygen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Some of the acids are; but the caustic property of a body depends not
only upon the quantity of oxygen which it contains, but also upon its
slight affinity for that principle, and the consequent facility with
which it yields&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Is not this destructive property of oxygen accounted for?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It proceeds probably from the strong attraction of oxygen for
hydrogen; for if the one rapidly absorb the other from the animal fibre,
a&nbsp;disorganisation of the substance must ensue.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Caustics are, then, very properly said to burn the flesh, since the
combination of oxygen and hydrogen is an actual combustion.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">351</span>
<a name = "page351" id = "page351"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Now, I think, this effect would be more properly termed an oxydation,
as there is no disengagement of light and heat.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>But there really is a sensation of heat produced by the action of
caustics.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>If oxygen is so caustic, why does not that which is contained in the
atmosphere burn&nbsp;us?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Because it is in a gaseous state, and has a greater attraction for
its electricity than for the hydrogen of our bodies. Besides, should the
air be slightly caustic, we are in a great measure sheltered from its
effects by the skin; you know how much a wound, however trifling, smarts
on being exposed to&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It is a curious idea, however, that we should live in a slow fire.
But, if the air was caustic, would it not have an acrid taste?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It possibly may have such a taste; though in so
<span class = "pagenum">352</span>
<a name = "page352" id = "page352"> </a>
slight a degree, that custom has rendered it insensible.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And why is not water caustic? When I dip my hand into water, though
cold, it ought to burn me from the caustic nature of its oxygen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Your hand does not decompose the water; the oxygen in that state is
much better supplied with hydrogen than it would be by animal matter,
and if its causticity depend on its affinity for that principle, it will
be very far from quitting its state of water to act upon your hand. You
must not forget that oxyds are caustic in proportion as the oxygen
adheres slightly to them.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>Since the oxyd of arsenic is poisonous, its acid, I&nbsp;suppose, is
fully as much&nbsp;so?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; it is one of the strongest poisons in nature.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>There is a poison called <i>verdigris</i>, which forms on brass and
copper when not kept very clean; and this, I&nbsp;have heard, is an
objection to these
<span class = "pagenum">353</span>
<a name = "page353" id = "page353"> </a>
metals being made into kitchen utensils. Is this poison likewise
occasioned by oxygen?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is produced by the intervention of oxygen; for verdigris is a
compound salt formed by the union of vinegar and copper; it is of a
beautiful green colour, and much used in painting.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But, I believe, verdigris is often formed on copper when no vinegar
has been in contact with&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not real verdigris, but compound salts, somewhat resembling it, may
be produced by the action of any acid on copper.</p>

<p>The solution of copper in nitric acid, if evaporated, affords a salt
which produces an effect on tin that will surprise you, and I have
prepared some from the solution we made before, that I might show it to
you. I&nbsp;shall first sprinkle some water on this piece of tin-foil,
and then some of the salt.&mdash;Now observe that I fold it up suddenly,
and press it into one lump.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What a prodigious vapour issues from it&mdash;and sparks of fire I
declare!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">354</span>
<a name = "page354" id = "page354"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>I thought it would surprise you. The effect, however, I&nbsp;dare say
you could account for, since it is merely the consequence of the oxygen
of the salt rapidly entering into a closer combination with the tin.</p>

<p>There is also a beautiful green salt too curious to be omitted; it is
produced by the combination of cobalt with muriatic acid, which has the
singular property of forming what is called <i>sympathetic ink</i>.
Characters written with this solution are invisible when cold, but when
a gentle heat is applied, they assume a fine bluish green colour.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I think one might draw very curious landscapes with the assistance of
this ink; I&nbsp;would first make a water-colour drawing of a
winter-scene, in which the trees should be leafless, and the grass
scarcely green: I&nbsp;would then trace all the verdure with the
invisible ink, and whenever I chose to create spring, I&nbsp;should hold
it before the fire, and its warmth would cover the landscape with a rich
verdure.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That will be a very amusing experiment, and I advise you by all means
to try&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "mynote">
Several cobalt compounds, including the cobalt chloride described here,
are still in use as invisible (“sympathetic”) inks. They are safe if
used appropriately.</p>

<p>Before we part, I must introduce to your acquaintance the curious
metals which Sir H. Davy
<span class = "pagenum">355</span>
<a name = "page355" id = "page355"> </a>
has recently discovered. The history of these extraordinary bodies is
yet so much in its infancy, that I shall confine myself to a very short
account of them; it is more important to point out to you the vast, and
apparently inexhaustible, field of research which has been thrown open
to our view by Sir H. Davy’s memorable discoveries, than to enter into a
minute account of particular bodies or experiments.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>But I have heard that these discoveries, however splendid and
extraordinary, are not very likely to prove of any great benefit to the
world, as they are rather objects of curiosity than of use.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Such may be the illiberal conclusions of the ignorant and
narrow-minded; but those who can duly estimate the advantages of
enlarging the sphere of science, must be convinced that the acquisition
of every new fact, however unconnected it may at first appear with
practical utility, must ultimately prove beneficial to mankind. But
these remarks are scarcely applicable to the present subject; for some
of the new metals have already proved eminently useful as chemical
agents, and are likely soon to be employed in the arts. For the
enumeration of these metals, I&nbsp;must refer you to our list of simple
bodies; they are derived from the alkalies, the
<span class = "pagenum">356</span>
<a name = "page356" id = "page356"> </a>
earths, and three of the acids, all of which had been hitherto
considered as undecompoundable or simple bodies.</p>

<p>When Sir H. Davy first turned his attention to the effects of the
Voltaic battery, he tried its power on a variety of compound bodies, and
gradually brought to light a number of new and interesting facts, which
led the way to more important discoveries. It would be highly
interesting to trace his steps in this new department of science, but it
would lead us too far from our principal object. A&nbsp;general view of
his most remarkable discoveries is all that I can aim at, or that you
could, at present, understand.</p>

<p>The facility with which compound bodies yielded to the Voltaic
electricity, induced him to make trial of its effects on substances
hitherto considered as simple, but which he suspected of being compound,
and his researches were soon crowned with the most complete success.</p>

<p>The body which he first submitted to the Voltaic battery, and which
had never yet been decomposed, was one of the fixed alkalies, called
potash. This substance gave out an elastic fluid at the positive wire,
which was ascertained to be oxygen, and at the negative wire, small
globules of a very high metallic lustre, very similar in appearance to
mercury; thus proving that potash, which had hitherto been considered as
a simple incombustible body,
<span class = "pagenum">357</span>
<a name = "page357" id = "page357"> </a>
was in fact a metallic oxyd; and that its incombustibility proceeded
from its being already combined with oxygen.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>I suppose the wires used in this experiment were of platina, as they
were when you decomposed water; for if of iron, the oxygen would have
combined with the wire, instead of appearing in the form of gas.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Certainly: the metal, however, would equally have been disengaged.
Sir H. Davy has distinguished this new substance by the name of <span
class = "smallroman">POTASSIUM</span>, which is derived from that of the
alkali, from which it is procured. I&nbsp;have some small pieces of it
in this phial, but you have already seen it, as it is the metal which we
burnt in contact with sulphur.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What is the liquid in which you keep it?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>It is naptha, a bituminous liquid, with which I shall hereafter make
you acquainted. It is almost the only fluid in which potassium can be
preserved, as it contains no oxygen, and this metal has so powerful an
attraction for oxygen, that it will not only absorb it from the air, but
likewise from water, or any body whatever that contains&nbsp;it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">358</span>
<a name = "page358" id = "page358"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>This, then, is one of the bodies that oxydates spontaneously without
the application of heat?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Yes; and it has this remarkable peculiarity that it attracts oxygen
much more rapidly from water than from air; so that when thrown into
water, however cold, it actually bursts into flame. I&nbsp;shall now
throw a small piece, about the size of a pin’s head, on this drop of
water.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It instantaneously exploded, producing a little flash of light! this
is, indeed, a&nbsp;most curious substance!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>By its combustion it is reconverted into potash; and as potash is now
decidedly a compound body, I&nbsp;shall not enter into any of its
properties till we have completed our review of the simple bodies; but
we may here make a few observations on its basis, potassium. If this
substance is left in contact with air, it rapidly returns to the state
of potash, with a disengagement of heat, but without any flash of
light.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But is it not very <ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘singulr’">singular</ins>
that it should burn better in water than in air?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">359</span>
<a name = "page359" id = "page359"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>I do not think so: for if the attraction of potassium for oxygen is
so strong that it finds no more difficulty in separating it from the
hydrogen in water, than in absorbing it from the air, it will no doubt
be more amply and rapidly supplied by water than by air.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>That cannot, however, be precisely the reason, for when potassium is
introduced under water, without contact of air, the combustion is not so
rapid, and indeed, in that case, there is no luminous appearance; but a
violent action takes place, much heat is excited, the potash is
regenerated, and hydrogen gas is evolved.</p>

<p>Potassium is so eminently combustible, that instead of requiring,
like other metals, an elevation of temperature, it will burn rapidly in
contact with water, even below the freezing point. This you may witness
by throwing a piece on this lump of ice.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It again exploded with flame, and has made a deep hole in the
ice.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This hole contains a solution of potash; for the alkali being
extremely soluble, disappears in the
<span class = "pagenum">360</span>
<a name = "page360" id = "page360"> </a>
water at the instant it is produced. Its presence, however, may be
easily ascertained, alkalies having the property of changing paper,
stained with turmeric, to a red colour; if you dip one end of this slip
of paper into the hole in the ice you will see it change colour, and the
same, if you wet it with the drop of water in which the first piece of
potassium was burnt.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>It has indeed changed the paper from yellow to red.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>This metal will burn likewise in carbonic acid gas, a&nbsp;gas that
had always been supposed incapable of supporting combustion, as we were
unacquainted with any substance that had a greater attraction for oxygen
than carbon. Potassium, however, readily decomposes this gas, by
absorbing its oxygen, as I shall show you. This retort is filled with
carbonic acid gas.&mdash;I&nbsp;will put a small piece of potassium in
it; but for this combustion a slight elevation of temperature is
required, for which purpose I shall hold the retort over the lamp.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>Now it has taken fire, and burns with violence! It has burst the
retort.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">361</span>
<a name = "page361" id = "page361"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Here is the piece of regenerated potash; can you tell me why it is
become so black?</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>No doubt it is blackened by the carbon, which, when its oxygen
entered into combination with the potassium, was deposited on its
surface.</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>You are right. This metal is perfectly fluid at the temperature of
one hundred degrees; at fifty degrees it is solid, but soft and
malleable; at thirty-two degrees it is hard and brittle, and its
fracture exhibits an appearance of confused crystallization. It is
scarcely more than half as heavy as water; its specific gravity being
about six when water is reckoned at ten; so that this metal is actually
lighter than any known fluid, even than ether.</p>

<p>Potassium combines with sulphur and phosphorus, forming sulphurets
and phosphurets; it likewise forms alloys with several metals, and
amalgamates with mercury.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>But can a sufficient quantity of potassium be obtained, by means of
the Voltaic battery, to admit of all its properties and relations to
other bodies being satisfactorily ascertained?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">362</span>
<a name = "page362" id = "page362"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Not easily; but I must not neglect to inform you that a method of
obtaining this metal in considerable quantities has since been
discovered. Two eminent French chemists, Thenard and <ins class =
"correction" title = "name generally hyphenated as ‘Gay-Lussac’">Gay
Lussac</ins>, stimulated by the triumph which Sir H. Davy had obtained,
attempted to separate potassium from its combination with oxygen, by
common chemical means, and without the aid of electricity. They caused
red hot potash in a state of fusion to filter through iron turnings in
an iron tube, heated to whiteness. Their experiment was crowned with the
most complete success; more potassium was obtained by this single
operation, that could have been collected in many weeks by the most
diligent use of the Voltaic battery.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>In this experiment, I suppose, the oxygen quitted its combination
with the potassium to unite with the iron turnings?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>Exactly so; and the potassium was thus obtained in its simple state.
From that time it has become a most convenient and powerful instrument
of deoxygenation in chemical experiments. This important improvement,
engrafted on Sir H. Davy’s previous discoveries, served but to add to
his glory, since the facts which he had established,
<span class = "pagenum">363</span>
<a name = "page363" id = "page363"> </a>
when possessed of only a few atoms of this curious substance, and the
accuracy of his analytical statements, were all confirmed when an
opportunity occurred of repeating his experiments upon this substance,
which can now be obtained in unlimited quantities.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>What a satisfaction Sir H. Davy must have felt, when by an effort of
genius he succeeded in bringing to light and actually giving existence,
to these curious bodies, which without him might perhaps have ever
remained concealed from our view!</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>The next substance which Sir H. Davy submitted to the influence of
the Voltaic battery was <i>Soda</i>, the other fixed alkali, which
yielded to the same powers of decomposition; from this alkali too,
a&nbsp;metallic substance was obtained, very analogous in its properties
to that which had been discovered in potash; Sir H. Davy has called it
<span class = "smallroman">SODIUM</span>. It is rather heavier than
potassium, though considerably lighter than water; it is not so easily
fusible as potassium.</p>

<p>Encouraged by these extraordinary results, Sir H. Davy next performed
a series of beautiful experiments on <i>Ammonia</i>, or the volatile
alkali, which, from analogy, he was led to suspect might also contain
oxygen. This he soon ascertained to be the
<span class = "pagenum">364</span>
<a name = "page364" id = "page364"> </a>
fact, but he has not yet succeeded in obtaining the basis of ammonia in
a separate state; it is from analogy, and from the power which the
volatile alkali has, in its gaseous form, to oxydate iron, and also from
the amalgams which can be obtained from ammonia by various processes,
that the proofs of that alkali being also a metallic oxyd are
deduced.</p>

<p>Thus, then, the three alkalies, two of which had always been
considered as simple bodies, have now lost all claim to that title, and
I have accordingly classed the alkalies amongst the compounds, whose
properties we shall treat of in a future conversation.</p>

<p class = "speaker">EMILY.</p>

<p>What are the other newly discovered metals which you have alluded to
in your list of simple bodies?</p>

<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They are the metals of the earths which became next the object of Sir
H. Davy’s researches; these bodies had never yet been decomposed, though
they were strongly suspected not only of being compounds, but of being
metallic oxyds. From the circumstance of their incombustibility it was
conjectured, with some plausibility, that they might possibly be bodies
that had been already burnt.</p>

<p class = "speaker">CAROLINE.</p>

<p>And metals, when oxydated, become, to all appearance, a&nbsp;kind of
earthy substance.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">365</span>
<a name = "page365" id = "page365"> </a>
<p class = "speaker">MRS. B.</p>

<p>They have, besides, several features of resemblance with metallic
oxyds; Sir H. Davy had therefore great reason to be sanguine in his
expectations of decomposing them, and he was not disappointed. He could
not, however, succeed in obtaining the basis of the earths in a pure
separate state; but metallic alloys were formed with other metals, which
sufficiently proved the existence of the metallic basis of the
earths.</p>

<p>The last class of new metallic bodies which Sir H. Davy discovered
was obtained from the three undecompounded acids, the boracic, the
fluoric, and the muriatic acids; but as you are entirely unacquainted
with these bodies, I&nbsp;shall reserve the account of their
decomposition till we come to treat of their properties as acids.</p>

<p>Thus in the course of two years, by the unparalleled exertions of a
single individual, chemical science has assumed a new aspect. Bodies
have been brought to light which the human eye never before beheld, and
which might have remained eternally concealed under their impenetrable
disguise.</p>

<p>It is impossible at the present period to appreciate to their full
extent the consequences which science or the arts may derive from these
discoveries; we may, however, anticipate the most important results.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">366</span>
<a name = "page366" id = "page366"> </a>
<p>In chemical analysis we are now in possession of more energetic
agents of decomposition than were ever before known.</p>

<p>In geology new views are opened, which will probably operate a
revolution in that obscure and difficult science. It is already proved
that all the earths, and, in fact, the solid surface of this globe, are
metallic bodies mineralized by oxygen, and as our planet has been
calculated to be considerably more dense upon the whole than on the
surface, it is reasonable to suppose that the interior part is composed
of a metallic mass, the surface of which only has been mineralized by
the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The eruptions of volcanos, those stupendous problems of nature, admit
now of an easy explanation. For if the bowels of the earth are the grand
recess of these newly discovered inflammable bodies, whenever water
penetrates into them, combustions and explosions must take place; and it
is remarkable that the lava which is thrown out, is the very kind of
substance which might be expected to result from these combustions.</p>

<p>I must now take my leave of you; we have had a very long conversation
to-day, and I hope you will be able to recollect what you have learnt.
At our next interview we shall enter on a new subject.</p>
